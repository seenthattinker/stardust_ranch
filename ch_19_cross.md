The Crossroad
===============

The human race is at a crossroads.
We have done as much as we can with our technological paradigm.
We've been on a *boom boom* economy for more than a century,
where boom is the explosion of gasoline igniting in a chamber.
The last one hundred and twenty years can be defined by three main things
&mdash;
electrical illumination at night,
rapid transport (at least faster than horse or walking),
and disembodied voice.
Aside from this not much has happened.
A lot of the ancillary deficits have been enormous as well,
but nobody is really keeping track of that.
There is no missing consciousness social science in the academic world,
no minister of consciousness at the governmental level,
or so it seems upon first glance.
It's a curious oddity that the things least talked about in public society are the things most talked about in secret societies.
Consciousness is the most studied thing in the intelligence world.
It doesn't seem that way because we're not explicitly told,
however,
we are tacitly told all the time,
and here we come once again to the military-industrial-entertainment complex,
the latter being music and movies,
which have been the largest fabricator of global consciousness.
It's here we're allowed to entertain all notions of imagination,
talking to animals,
going into space,
the nature of time,
and the nature of consciousness.
It's become stock in these farces to portray the hero as imbalanced for entertaining premodern realities,
whether it be Indiana Jones explaining to us through his exploits in *Raiders of the Lost Ark* that the Nazi regime was very much involved in premodern culture,
the esoteric,
the magical,
and any manner of things we can enjoy in a movie cinema and regard as silly superstition the moment we leave the cinema,
or Christopher Nolan showing us the idea of planting an idea in someone's mind while they sleep,
or hacking someone's mind in his film *Inception*. 
We laugh it off the moment we leave the cinema.
The truth is the intelligence world is heavily focused on the occult,
and it always has been,
even way before the time John Dee entertained the British Monarchy as the court sorcerer.
Nor can we assume for a moment that institutions like the Vatican are unaware, 
either.
They are another early pioneer of the intelligence world,
with each and every archdiocese operating as an embassy,
and what do embassies have?
They have ambassadors for relationship maintenance,
trade delegates to expand commercial interests,
and spies.
That triumvirate has been as consistent for the last millennia as light,
transport,
and disembodied voice have been to the last one hundred years.
It couldn't be that Spielberg and Nolan are telling us a truth in their films.
No,
of course not.
Yet they are.
They are not telling us *the* truth to the last detail,
instead they are telling us *a* truth.


We forget how new the thought bubble we live in is.
It's less than one hundred and fifty years old. 
It begins with three things
&mdash;
light,
transportation,
and disembodied voice.


##Light


The illumination of cities really cannot be understated.
Wabash,
Indiana was the first town to introduce electric street lights in the United States.
That was in 1880.
The effect of this was staggering.
Commerce could now operate twenty-four hours a day.
The old gas lamps that fueled the whaling industry were sufficient to keep busy streets illuminated at night in London and other European locales,
but they were no match for the productivity boom that electrical illumination would bring.


Illumination changed everything.
As it spread into the larger cities it fueled a night culture.
Night had been a highly underutilized part of the day for the human race.
We had lived much more within the circadian rhythm of the planet.
People worked on the land,
and they went to bed early and rose early.
It was a natural cycle.
Illumination broke that cycle.
More and more people began to work at night.
Businesses that could continue their revenue streams at night did so.
Most importantly,
we began to generate our own electrical fields.
Not much attention has been paid to this,
at least not in the public space.
Electrical fields have had a very profound effect on human beings.
We ourselves are electrical beings.
Illumination at night produced a lot of intellectual work that could be done.
All that was required was a light and a desk.

Not much has changed with the electrical system we put in over a century ago.
What we have not done as a species is take stock of what this changes brought about.
It begins simply enough with illumination and cities,
but other changes were made to human existence.
People don't make the connections.
It was also the very first monthly bill.
Of course there were other monies owed.
Many farms were under mortgage if they were not family-owned,
but family owned land was a big part of the American landscape.
It is safe to say that the electrical bill was the first monthly bill introduced into modern society.
If you wanted to enjoy this other part of the day,
the night,
you had to pay.
The electrical system that we chose,
the AC/DC system,
was specifically selected for its ability to generate revenue and be measured on a meter,
which produced the monthly bill.
The month is a lunar cycle,
like women's menstruation, 
so it seems natural. 
A great effort has been made to *mimic* the natural world in the modern and post-modern worlds.

If you look at the average household now in the early twenty-first century there is a laundry list of monthly bills
&mdash;
mortgage or rent,
electricity,
gas or fuel,
home insurance,
life insurance, 
phone bill,
data usage for phone,
sports and music lessons for children,
school fees,
daycare,
groceries,
public transportation monthly pass (train or bus),
parking,
cable television,
and the list could go on almost ad nausea.
You get the point.
The electrical bill started it all,
and now we live in perpetually illuminated cities,
even the daytime is illuminated now with digital billboards,
and the unnatural cycle we follow in bills,
all matched to the moon's cycle
&mdash;
monthly.
Our fiscal year follows the seasons,
four seasons matched to four quarters in the markets,
all a mimicry of the harvest.






##Rapid Transport

The next big push forward was the combustion engine.
This took away the necessity of horsepower in a very short period of time.
The coal fired steam engine had been around for passenger trains,
but the autonomy and independence of the personal automobile was a major step forward in the ability of human beings to move freely on the planet.


The combustion engine was just the beginning.
The first major breakthrough comes with an American named Henry Ford.
He created something astounding.
He created the first factory and the first assembly line.
The assembly line parted work into various units or tasks and guaranteed the production time of a completed unit.
It was a major step forward for industry and a major step backward for human ingenuity and creativity.
I characterize it as a step backward for human ingenuity and creativity because human beings are no longer required to create something.
Manufacturing something and creating something are far different.
Just take a moment and think of all the people you've seen interviewed in the last twenty-five years,
all of the people who are smiling and happy,
the chief executive officers of large corporations,
the Hollywood actors,
the inventors and successful entrepreneurs,
are all part of the creative class.
Creative people are the happiest people on the planet.
This is because of the fundamental truth that man is a creative being.
When a human being is creative they are literally commiserating with the creator.
This is a very important point to understand,
and it's one of the things that separates us from extremely advanced extraterrestrial races.


Prior to industrialization,
human beings participated in their cultures and their cultures were the main repository of their creativity.
Native storytelling in ritual was the height of human expression.
In context of the world we've created in the twenty-first century what I'm saying seems ridiculous,
but stay with me.
In the end you will be rewarded with an epiphany,
which,
in classical parlance,
means the sudden appearance of a god,
and,
in modern parlance,
a sudden change of consciousness.
What Henry Ford did was guarantee a material living for people who manufactured.
All promise of a creative life was forfeited by those who went into the manufacturing sector.


With the ability to move vast distances in a short period of time,
human beings began to grow in new ways.
Anyone with a car could take off and see vast swatches of their country,
something which had not been possible in centuries previous.
Most people lived a localized life,
a kind of village life or tribal life minus the actual native culture.
When we began to move around we begin to encounter people who are not like us.



From this ability to move around comes another expansion of our commercial expression.
Things had always been traded by boat and by train,
but the distribution points were extremely limited.
With the advent of the combustion engine and the automobile made cheaper through the manufacturing process of Henry Ford,
radical transformations to our society comes about.
From the combustion engine comes the oil economy.
The first dynasties in America where banking and oil.
Prior to them people could gain notoriety and wealth through massive farm operations,
but nothing approximating what was achievable through the centralized command of corporations and the distribution power of the combustion engine.
The trucking industry began.
In one generation we have a figure in Jimmy Hoffa who comes to rival the power of the President of the United States simply by being the leader of the Teamsters Union which controls all trucking in America.



From this point onward we get the great standoff between labor and capital,
which remains fundamentally unresolved until corporations successfully lobby government to commence free trade,
culminating in the Free Trade agreement between Canada and the US,
coincidentally around the time the Berlin Wall was coming down,
which had *forced* economic cooperation between nations
&mdash;
economy of scale being the common denominator.
The purpose of free trade from the corporate perspective was to allow companies to increase profits by seeking out labor at pennies on the dollar compared to what the unions had driven the labor costs up to in North America.
We also get a further commingling of the human race.
Prior to free trade and international commerce there really wasn't a lot of interaction between human civilizations except through colonization,
which was practiced mainly by the British with ancillary roles played by the French,
the Portuguese,
and the Spanish,
with the Vatican operating as the godfather
&mdash;
*el padrino*.



##Disembodied Voice


The first example of the projected voice is the radio.
The radio comes about as a household appliance in the early twentieth century.
Only the voice is projected.
Families used to sit around on a Saturday night and listen to a broadcast from a centralized location.
This was the beginning of a new form of culture as well,
the beginning of a digital culture.
The characteristics of a digital culture are profoundly different from the characteristics of a community.
Of course the first radios were not digital as we use the word now.
They were analog.
Digital is just the word I choose to encompass the idea of disembodied voices.
This new culture allowed people to participate in cultures larger than their community.
This radically changed human consciousness,
whether we realize it or not.

From the radio we move to the telephone.
The telephone precedes the radio but I place radio more prominently in my thesis because no wires were needed.
It was voice liberated from the clumsy poles and wires telephones required,
like a nervous system minus the body.
Suddenly commerce changes dramatically.
You can communicate over vast geography without getting on a steam ship or using carrier pigeons.
The movement of the disembodied voice into two-way private communication through telephones changed everything,
and it extended the utility of electricity which brought the nighttime illumination.
They started to work in concert,
the disembodied voices,
the nighttime illumination,
and the rapid transportation.

The disembodied voice becomes the disembodied person when film comes about,
at first,
rather comically if you consider it,
minus the voice.
The first films were silent films.
They had to figure out how to combine the voice and the picture,
but that didn't take too long.
Then the transportation moved into the transport of the voice and the form as it appeared in real life,
a perfect two-dimensional replication of the human experience as it came through our senses,
and what did we populate talking pictures with
&mdash; 
the imagination we officially left in the premodern era.
The only problem with this is that the human experience,
the inner and outer human being,
were separated.
In the past they had been unified. 
That's what people are looking for when they go to Peru to do ayahuasca,
the unification of the inner and outer person.
It's interesting to note that many people who have tried ayahuasca speak about meeting extraterrestrials,
seeing flying saucers,
and interacting with non-human beings,
a lot like my ranch.
How do we know about ayahuasca?
The plants spoke to the natives and revealed themselves.
The speaking with the plants the natives refer to is in dreams,
but the things revealed to them are of the world,
scientifically and precisely of the world,
a union of the inner and the outer,
the whole man understanding nature.
Please do not confuse my example with an endorsement of ayahuasca.
There are many ways to understand the inner and the outer as the whole being,
and ayahuasca was developed for native cultures,
not for recreational spiritualists from the West who abuse it.

From film we move to computers and the advent of the true digital age,
where a two-dimensional representation of voice and picture can be used any time with video calling.
Then they packaged it all in hand-held devices,
but the same trinity persists
&mdash;
illumination,
transport,
and disembodied voice,
all the things premodern societies had in their imaginations.



##The Trinity of the Modern and Post-Modern


These three things
&mdash;
electrical illumination, 
rapid transportation, 
and disembodied voices 
&mdash;
form the trinity of the modern and the postmodern age.
Nothing we've done has really changed this principle trinity which is responsible for the massive social and cultural change the human race has gone through.
We are no longer a genuine culture.
In the quiet and stillness of the past age we articulated a relationship with the fourth dimension.
It comes through in our folklore,
our mythologies,
our superstitions,
and our spiritual culture,
where spiritual just means knowledge of self outside of the body.
It doesn't mean the individual consciousness has migrated all the way back to its source.




In his work at Harvard,
John Mack equates the abduction phenomenon with religious and spiritual experience,
which he notes seems to end as a cultural phenomenon around the beginning of the Industrial Age.
It's an interesting observation by Mack.
Experiences which were participatory in the past become part of the observational sciences of the emerging Western consciousness
&mdash;
anthropology,
history,
archaeology,
sociology,
and psychiatry.
The entirety of human consciousness gets hijacked at the end of the nineteenth century,
gone is the wistful interrelationship with imagination that marked premodern civilizations.
It's all brain health,
lobes in the brain,
electrical impulses,
and pharmacology,
the absence of imagination being a very lucrative economy.
That's the official public narrative,
anyway.
The only person allowed to speak as an expert in the area of human consciousness in a court of law is a psychiatrist.
Are we then saying they are the repository of all knowledge about human consciousness?
They have the power to administer custodial incarceration to an individual. 
Yet,
much like the electrical engineer who can't tell you what electricity is,
psychiatry can't tell us what schizophrenia is,
but they are convinced the voices in the afflicted's heads are auditory hallucinations.
It certainly can't be,
as Jerry Marzinsky states,
that they are possessed.
That would align consciousness with more than one dimension,
and the name of the game from the inception of the modern age has been to flatten human consciousness to one reality,
this three-dimensional reality,
and it has been done intentionally in full knowledge that man is a multidimensional being.


As the modern world began to take shape new organizational principles came into being.
The automobile necessitated oil,
roads,
and street lights.
Somebody had to pay for it.
They created banking and formed the US Federal Reserve in 1913,
and the sixteenth amendment made income tax legal in the same year,
1913.
The government created a bank to borrow money from on behalf of the people,
who,
in a sense,
are cosigners on the borrowing.
A citizen became a partner,
a partner with liability. 
The modern age is trying to sweep man's transdimensional nature under the carpet.
They want a neat package now that isolates a human being from spiritual identity.
This is how we are controlled.
The only question remaining is who or what is controlling us?





Consent
------------------



The most important thing to understand is that we went from a poetic culture to a literal culture.
When we turned our backs on imagination we shut a door in ourselves,
a door that goes back to the source of creation.
Creation was finished the moment it began because it happened outside of time and space.
This means the parts of creation we can't see with our eyes we see with our imagination.
Everything documented in creation through our myths and fables is fundamentally true.
This does mot mean literally true.
It means that the mythologies when contemplated upon render a truth.

One of the biggest casualties of the death of imagination is God.
Religion has always been the repository of the imagination.
The famous Irish writer James Joyce was uncannily accurate in his first novel,
*Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* when he gave up his birth religion of Catholicism to become,
as his central character Stephan Dedalus put it,
*a priest of the imagination*.
Joyce did not give up on the imagination as the doorway to God,
he rejected the control of the imagination the priests had.
He wanted to know for himself,
not take someone else's word for it.

The death of the imagination is spiritual death while alive,
and spiritual death has many characteristics
&mdash;
illness,
mental instability,
breach of consciousness,
(read possession and occupation here).
Have you noticed the explosion of horror movies featuring possession
&mdash;
the *Paranormal Activity* franchise (six installments with a seventh scheduled for 2021),
the *Insidious* franchise (four installments so far),
*The Nun*,
and too many more to list here.
One could make the case we're fascinated by possession.
It's a symptom of the death of imagination.


In nature all thing are preyed upon.
Almost everything created controls the population of something else in creation.
We see this in the water,
on the land,
and in the air.
Nothing in nature is safe from predation except the top predators in any given ecosystem.
In the rainforests of Central America the jaguar is atop the cycle of predation,
but,
like any top predator they are susceptible to any failures in the ecosystem.
If the salmon stocks fail in northern Canada then the bears run the risk of starving.
The populations of top predators in their ecosystem is dependent on the maintenance of the ecosystem,
what we might call the liability of kings.

We started observing culture at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
Before that,
culture was participated in,
not observed.
The imagination was lived,
not discarded. 
The seminal work that commenced the field of anthropology was 
*The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion*,
by Sir James George Frazer,
a knighted Scotsman.
The book is a comparative study of religion and mythology,
a brilliant foundation for the emerging science of anthropology.
It was published in 1890,
again curiously centered in this emerging objective culture of the Industrial Revolution.

Frazer postulated that man moves through three stages
&mdash;
magic,
religion,
then science.
In magical thinking,
the culture is attempting to directly control the forces of nature through magical rituals.
The succession of kings was a magical ritual in Frazer's work,
the death and resurrection of the king was an unconscious metaphor for the setting and rising of the sun,
and for the natural rhythm of seasons.
In his first edition he included Christ in this metaphor of the resurrecting of a king.
It was scandalous at the time.
In religious thinking the human population petitions an intermediary to control the forces of nature.
In scientific thinking we believe we can control the forces of nature,
but a quick look at the state of the world nullifies this assertion.
Nature is furious with us.
Religion has become the most resilient aspect of the imagination,
a kind of lone survivor of the Industrial and Technological Revolutions. 
They collectively participated in the murder of paganism,
deeming their religions superior to the tribal *superstitions* that preceded them.
Religion has always been the only institutionalized form of imagination,
the only form of imagination to register,
get licenses,
tax waivers,
and be officially sanctioned in the industrial and technological ages.
Religion represents the institutionalized imagination.
The problem is the imagination cannot be institutionalized,
nor can love or compassion.
These are uniquely human characteristics.

Institutional compassion is the biggest lie ever told to the human race.
Compassion can only be given by a living being.
I say living being because it's not just human beings that can demonstrate compassion.
Other evolved mammals on earth can show compassion.
So what happens when we institutionalize everything,
education,
social benefits,
child protective services,
correctional services through prisons,
drug and alcohol rehabilitation,
and the myriad codes,
statutes,
and acts that govern the flow of commerce?
Nothing happens.
The intended correction never occurs.
The growth into imagination never occurs. 
So why do we do it in the first place? 
How did we become so detached from ourselves,
so distant from a true human experience,
so subservient to the cult of expertise?
We were tricked into giving our consent is the simplest possible answer.
Nothing can happen without consent.


##Reptilians, Black Magic and Satanism

You may be wondering why in a book about an alien infested ranch with portals I'm talking about labor,
capital,
the late nineteenth century,
twentieth century,
the early twenty-first century,
the institutionalization of the human race,
the co-opting of all land on the planet into a fiduciary system,
and science.
Fundamentally these are realizations that have come about based on my encounters with extraterrestrials.
You see when you consider extraterrestrials you must think of the human race as a species.
Gone are all the divisions that have haunted us in the past,
the Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland,
the Israelis and the Palestinians,
the rich and the poor,
black and white,
big and small.
All of it goes away when you begin interacting with extraterrestrials.
Only one question remains.
What ails this species?
The human race.


I touched upon predation in nature.
The reason I did that is to point out that predation does not stop at the physical dimension.
Through our senses and our mind we are at the top of creation.
Nothing really preys upon us.
From time to time we read a story about somebody being mauled by a black bear in Northern Canada,
or attacked by a mountain lion in California,
or bitten by a shark in the Pacific Ocean,
but these things are extremely rare and it's safe to say that the human race is beyond predation.
But are we?
When we open up to the next dimension,
the fourth dimension,
where most of the extraterrestrial contact comes from,
a new landscape of predation emerges.
Human beings produce *things* that are of value to other species.


I also spoke about creation being finished because it took place outside of time and space.
That means that nobody really discovers anything,
that a human consciousness either wanders into a new geography of imagination and sees something,
either in a dream or a vision,
and then feverishly works on producing it in the world,
or it is given by a fourth dimensional being.
This has been the history of the human race as we go through this rapid period of invention and scientific innovation.
We've gone from outhouses and pasturing animals to space travel and a fully integrated world through the Internet in a century and a half.
More has happened in the last one hundred and fifty years than in the last one thousand years.
The question that remains is where did all this innovation come from?
The answer is that most of it is given to us.
If linear processes revealed everything in the worlds then we would master a linear process to reveal the entire universe to us.
No such linear process has come about.
The transmission of information from its inception to the general population can generally be done in a literal process.
Our education system is a linear process.
Children begin in kindergarten at five years of age and go on until whenever they stop,
some people getting multiple doctoral degrees.
The effect of all this linear process is the nullification of the creative process.
The mind is a tremendous mimic.
If you put human consciousness into a twenty year cycle of linear processes then consciousness will assume the modality of linear processes.
In the transference of information we forfeit the creativity at the individual level.


In understanding who is giving us information we have to understand the multi-dimensional reality in which we live.
We've already discussed that most of the native mythologies go back to star seedings.
The Navajo people of the American southwest talk about coming through portals to this planet.
Here we get to the greatest duality of my story,
the duality of predation at transdimensional level and the duality of self-interest and service to creation and the Creator.
It's important also to note at this point that the word extraterrestrial,
by the etymology alone,
encompasses everything not of the earth that engages with human beings as individuated forms.
Not many people consider how that includes all of the angels and demons and all of the gods that are populated in our religions.
The actual creator of this transdimensional reality is not an individuated form as we understand beings and entities.
The attribution of human qualities to the angels cannot be overlooked.
They are extraterrestrial.
They are not of the earth but they are individuated beings.
They even have names,
like the Archangel Michael and the Archangel Gabriel.
Even the gods we worship have names.


Our world has been influenced by and inadvertently governed by forces darker than you can imagine.
This is by far the most difficult part of the story to tell.
Much of this has been related to me through my contact with growth centered extraterrestrials.
I use the term *growth centered* because benign seems a little bit too personal.
There's nothing really personal with the extraterrestrials.
They don't want karmic entanglement with our species.
It gives them a standoffish attitude that at first I regarded as aloofness.
As I evolved through my engagements with them I understood better why they choose the protocols they do.
A growth centered extraterrestrial race is interested in the well-being of all things.
It's the same thing as a loving human being.
However,
the human being while alive will be more personally engaged in the lives of other human beings
&mdash;
spouse,
children,
extended family,
close friends,
and things like this.
These are karmic relationships.
The extraterrestrials don't have karma with our species.
A grave circumstance that you could imagine,
like an earthquake that could kill hundreds of millions of people,
elicits no emotional response from the extraterrestrials.
Being human we register this as cold,
but they follow a law that is higher,
from millions of years of mnemonic understanding of galaxies,
life,
growth,
species,
and it creates a disposition where the very notion of tragedy is spiritual pornography. 
They see things within incarnational patterns,
ages of our species forgotten to our history,
lost in time to us,
but not to them.
They have the ability to read the records of time and creation.
The minutest details of our existence on this planet and other planets is known to them.
They don't get emotional.

The human race has been in symbiotic relationships with negative extraterrestrials for millennia,
mainly reptilians from the Draco star system,
however they're not the only ones.
The reptilians go by many names in human history.
The Chinese and Japanese have dragon mythology.
The Egyptian Book of the Dead speaks of the alligator people.
Their drawings appear in temples and pyramids.
The Islamic culture makes reference to Jin appearing in either human or serpent form,
and the serpent in the Garden of Eden. 
The reptilians and a collection of self-serving races from the the Orion sector have had a profound impact on human history and development.
They are the basis of the Luciferian rebellion story. 
Many of our stories are true.
We just have difficulty as a species mapping the mythological to the literal.
It's part of the veil between our three-dimensional reality and the fourth dimension.

The laws of creation are clear for all,
and most races don't break them.
It's not out of any respect for the creational process,
but more by an understanding that breach of the law brings consequence.
The law of free will is is understood by human beings,
though it is often broken.
A human being is held to be sovereign,
as are all sentient beings.
However,
the art of breaching free will is manufacturing consent.
Nothing dictates that a bi-dimensional species like the reptilians cannot contract with a one dimensional species like human beings on earth.
The contracts never work out well for us. 
Absent context we lack the sophistry to make a good deal.
If this all sounds a lot like fable,
myth,
or literature,
it's because it is.
It is the contract with the devil,
the Faustian bargain. 
It's all real,
only substitute the literary and mythological figures of the stories and scriptures with the reptilians and you've gone from fable to fact.
It's that simple.

Reptilians are a fourth dimensional species that can engage human beings through mediums,
psychics,
ritual,
and sacrifice.
They can also possess and occupy a living human being,
and they have been running a hybrid incarnation program on planet earth for some time.
Most of the powerful people on the planet are reptilian,
whether they be in government or business or entertainment.
The reptilians love to live among us as venerated figures.
Absent meaningful relationship with the creation or the creator,
they draw their energy from us,
and from other mammalian species like us in this and nearby galaxies.

Whenever you see something lacking all humanity on the planet it's reptilian.
It's really been right in front of us the whole time.
We dress it up as something else
&mdash;
psychopathology,
sociopaths
&mdash;
but the thing they have in common is the ability to appear human with no humanity,
and what better to act with no humanity than something which is not human.
The reptilians are responsible for wars in this and neighboring galaxies that have lasted hundreds of thousands of years.
A truce has existed for some time but the Draco Reptilians in particular find ways to blur the lines,
one of which is us,
the human beings on planet earth.
It gets worse.


There is no spiritual figure called Satan.
It's just another aspect of the confusion surrounding mankind's inability to reconcile the mythological with the literal.
It doesn't help that a race of beings governing and manipulating us creates bi-dimensional narratives to confound and confuse people of religious sincerity.
Here we arrive at one of the moments where I reacted in front of the positive extraterrestrials who explained things to me
&mdash; *How could you allow this to go on!*
They weren't impressed or moved.
That's why I describe them as distant.
They're like gods watching from above as we find fire and invent the wheel,
knowing the eons it will take us to realize our multidimensional nature,
our connection with creation and the creator,
and the whole thing is completely natural,
including being preyed upon by a fourth dimensional race of scaled hominids. 
The perspective on the extraterrestrials who helped me understand my ranch?
It's a natural part of our growth cycle.
We got ourselves into it and we need to get ourselves out of it.
They do get involved.
The very fact that they're communicating with me and other people on the planet is evidence of that,
but it's an advisory role.


I got the feeling dealing with the extraterrestrials that we human beings were a proxy war,
that we were being used by them and the regressive extraterrestrials,
like the reptilians and the rogue grays that terrorized my ranch,
as a battle between themselves through us,
the way we saw the United States and the Soviet Union fought in Vietnam and other countries.
Sadly though,
it's darker and more pathetic than this.
Our main problem is not the reptilians.
It's the human beings who contract with them,
who bite the apple for want of the forbidden knowledge.


To understand what is happening on planet earth,
you must understand the dimensional nature  of existence.
Consciousness is actually spread across multiple dimensions.
The majority of our experience is concentrated in the densest dimension,
our physical reality on this planet.
At the next level,
the fourth dimension,
we have been an occupied species for some time.
It's part of the limited consciousness of the human race that we can't conceptualize an alien invasion as anything other than physical.
This is not the case.
We are occupied at the fourth dimension. 
Where this story goes now is not for the faint of heart.


There's no way for me to explain the situation except by giving you a very clear example of what I mean.
When nation states throughout history have warred with each other it has been for resources.
Here on the physical plane resource means physical wealth like land and water and minerals and human beings for slavery.
This is a very simple concept to understand.
We all live in this dimension.
Living in this Dimension we can understand what conquest and profiting from that conquest is,
but what is being sought when we're dealing with a species that is fully bi-dimensional like the reptilians?
If they exist largely in the fourth dimension with a limited presence in our three-dimensional reality what is it that they're looking for?
What is the plunder?
It's us.
We're the plunder,
but not in the limited sense of slavery.


Creation has endowed this human race with special qualities.
I've already told you that we are the product of multiple species in this universe.
Human beings possess the genetics of multiple extraterrestrial races.
In a sense,
we are an experiment.
We were over this material in the previous chapter.
This race,
the human race on planet earth,
has been given a very special gift.
The ability to know the Creator,
to hold the Creator in our consciousness.
Everything in creation seeks the Creator,
but many of the species that have been in existence for millions of years have made mistakes so severe that they have lost their path back to the Creator.
The main mistake that has been made is  self augmentation through technology.
We ourselves are right at that point now.
Transhumanism is right around the corner.
More to the point,
we are a delicacy on the fourth dimension.
The richness of our emotional constitution produces the equivalent of tastes for other species on the fourth Dimension.
Just as we can enjoy the taste of chocolate here on Earth,
these other species,
especially the reptilians,
savor our emotional taste and energy on the fourth dimension.
For lack of a better way of putting it,
it's the closest they can get to the Creator.



The situation became so severe in a later twentieth century that those who could see it might have compared the fourth dimension or at least the lower fourth dimension to a by dimensional crack house full of addicted species feeding off the human race.
The reptilians are literally addicted to us the way human beings can become addicted to crystal meth or crack or heroin.
The ingestion of the human energy is different.
Before we get to that,
I need to explain a few other things.


Part of cosmic law dictates that there must be a disclosure.
We discuss this in other parts of the book.
I've already told you how Hollywood is part of a disclosure mechanism about what's going on in the fourth dimension.
Disclosure is a cosmic law.
Nothing in creation exists outside of the law.
The name of the game is to get the consent of the person or species that you want to interact with.
The game that the reptilians have been playing is miscontextualized consent.
In a sense,
many of our religions are disclosure mechanisms.
Satan was invented to represent this fourth-dimensional conundrum.
If we behave a certain way,
the reptilians do not become a problem.
They are a feeding species and they feed off of our lower emotions,
our anger,
our rage,
our frustration,
our sadness,
our tears are like wine to them.
We get disclosure of this in the form of our religions.
The Catholic Church and the present Vatican is the most reptilian-centric organization on the planet right now.
Take a look at the Hall of the Pontifical Audiences in Rome,
then take a look at the sculpture that sits right behind where the pope sits.
All of these image are available on the Internet.
Can you see the serpent in the roof design?
Can you see suffering humanity in the sculpture?
Now,
many Catholics still under the spell might see this as symbolic of the struggle against the serpent in the garden,
but why represent that in the architecture?
Why not something more triumphant?
Why not something representative of God's love?
The Vatican is completely and utterly a reptilian institution now.
It's important to understand that as part of the *required* disclosure to which even the extraterrestrials are beholden
&mdash;
we must be told,
but how we are told,
whether it be on the six o'clock news,
or through a scripture or mythology,
is inconsequential
&mdash;
we have been told.




The characteristics of reptilian culture are horror,
terror,
rape,
murder,
pedophilia,
and the chemical harvesting of the human body that has been terrorized.
This is how they enjoy the energies of the human being.
We are consumed and ingested just as we consume the mammals that we eat on planet earth,
but we don't eat meat for a high.
We eat it for sustenance and for protein.
The reptilians consume us for a particular energy we produce that is like a narcotic to them.
This energy is produced in us at the base of the spine.
It goes by many names already spoken of in this book
&mdash;
chi,
prani,
ether,
or orgone,
to name a few
&mdash;
and it is stolen through rape,
specifically sodomy,
and the energy is particularly undiluted in children,
and,
specifically in prepubescent boys.
This explains the epidemic of pedophilia in the world now,
specifically in the West.
It's practiced heavily in the Catholic Church,
certain sects of Judaism,
among the Free Masons,
and other secret societies.
It's interesting to note that during the 2016 presidential run,
at the traditional preelection archdiocese dinner in New York City,
then candidate Trump alluded to missing children in Haiti.
It was an uncomfortable moment for Hillary Clinton in the audience.
Pedophilia raised its head again in the run up to the election in the form of Pizzagate,
which the media was quick to label a conspiracy theory.
Hillary's campaign manager,
John Podesta,
was the most talked about figure tied to pedophilia.
It was enough for him to lay low for a few months.
Podesta has tweeted numerous times about *disclosure*,
which has come to be the catchphrase for governments revealing *secret* information on UFOs and extraterrestrials.
There's a whole subculture involved in this now,
with television shows like *Ancient Aliens*,
but I can assure you what they are giving is allowable portions of the truth,
and they are only doing this now because the topic has built up such a presence in the collective unconscious,
the *spiritus mundi* that they have no choice.
Many of the powerful in the world have joined reptilian culture already.
It's human corollary is Satanism.
As I said already,
there is no Satan.
Satanism is the ritual culture given to humanity by the reptilians.
It steals the energies the reptilians want.
Many of the human practitioners are possessed by reptilians in the fourth dimension,
again,
what we call in in classical esoteric or occult terminology the astral plane.




We spoke earlier in this book about ancient knowledge brought forward from Atlantis.
The knowledge I speak of is the knowledge that was given to me living on my ranch in Rainbow Valley.
The earth has a series of electromagnetic anomalies,
or portals,
that allow entities and beings from other dimensions to visit the Earth.
These other dimensions are completely real as I have demonstrated in my story.
The knowledge carried forward from Atlantis is the knowledge of the gridlines and the portals on the planet.
When you see war going on in the world there are only a few possible reasons for it.
It can be for a physical resource for monetary control,
and here oil comes to mind,
or it is a war for ancient artifacts that explain the past or an existing portal.
The ultimate irony of our age is that at the public level we believe that we are ruled by reason,
objectivity,
and science.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
We are ruled by black magic.
Along with the portals,
the rulers of this world hold an ancient knowledge of magic and ritual.
As difficult as this is for people to believe,
I assure you magic is real and it influences everything on this planet.
The Germans were the first to build spacecraft on earth.
They did this during World War II.
For those who cannot reconcile science and magic,
ask yourselves this:
why did such a scientifically advanced people like the Germans entertain rituals,
an obsession with the occult,
ancient artifacts,
and ritual magic? 
The answer is because the two things go together.
It has to do with the subjective
&mdash;
human interior and imagination
&mdash;
and the objective
&mdash;
the world of tangible reality.

In his work 
*Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*,
the writer Hunter S Thompson gives us one the first public reference to adrenochrome,
a drug produced by the adrenal gland,
and made richer for the participant by putting the victim it is harvested from through absolute terror prior to harvest,
which kills the human producer.
It is a drug revered by the Satanic elite,
both for its effects and its procurement.
The effect is bi-dimensional consciousness in a degree far greater than any of the natural psychedelics,
including ayahuasca. 
The procurement kills the human being in a pageant of terror and violence,
fulfilling the Satanic edict of desecrating the human being.
Do you see how it all goes together now?
There is no Satan.
The hatred for humanity attributed to this mythical figure is a cover story for inter-species contempt
&mdash;
human and reptilian
&mdash;
and the bi-dimensional nature of the reptilians,
though they can appear on the earth and many of them live here now in human form,
which means their physical form is human,
achieved either through a hybrid birthing program,
like the one described in this book that produced Cynthia Crawford,
and remember,
she goes as far back as the OSS days,
so imagine what they can do today,
or a human being is possessed by a reptilian.

Now we can sum up the situation.
All of the science and systems we have developed and brought into the world since the the late nineteenth century are flawed,
and what's more,
they are deliberately flawed.
This includes the social sciences,
the medical sciences,
the hard sciences,
and the systems of governance that have evolved.
All of them have been constructed to murder the human imagination,
which is the human spirit in a diluted form.
It's no accident that all the truths of the premodern world have been erased. 
It's no accident that we have been incapacitated and reduced to spiritual infancy. 
It's been done so we don't see what's going on around us.
It's a herd mentality as they coral us into cities with Agenda 2030,
reinforced with all the bad energy through the cell towers and the electromagnetic poison,
and all of it done deliberately to bring this race to its knees.
You see,
we are not waiting for the Hollywood version of invasion where ships appear over cities,
the aliens are visible to everyone,
and its some version of a heroic journey. 
We have already been colonized.

In 1996 I moved onto Stardust Ranch.
I don't know if things always happen for a reason.
I believe they do.
After twenty-three years of living with portals and alien visitation,
both hostile and non-hostile,
I now have to share what I know with the world.
I'm John Edmonds and this is my story,
and my story,
as individual and uncommon as it is,
became the story of us all.
It has taken me this long to get my story out.
I couldn't tell it myself.
I had to find someone I could trust.
That happened in 2012 when I met Bruce MacDonald,
but it took this long to tell the story. 
I pray it finds the hearts and minds who can awaken the divine imagination to counter what has happened to the human race.
We are magnificent and beautiful beings,
and our story is far from over however bleak it may look. 
We hold the solutions to every problem within us,
and we will find our way to the majesty predestined in our species,
of this I have faith.
