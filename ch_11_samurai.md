Samurai John
========================

Everything I have described in this story so far did not stop.
We thought the abductions stopped,
but they didn't.
The negative energies that caused my erratic rages did not stop.
The sightings of the grays didn't stop.
There were other things going on as well,
things I haven't mentioned in this story so far,
mainly because I don't want to confuse people.
What changed was my ability to cope with what was going on.
The newest things in our lives,
repeated often enough,
become normal,
the new normal. 
I could feel the gray energy sneaking up on me,
but I didn't allow myself to become frustrated or angry.
I tried to coexist with it,
to transcend it.
I was successful in good measure.
It was my new normal.
I had been living with it for over a decade by that point.


I believe everything in this life is learned by experience.
The concept of faith is not lost on me.
Faith is the belief that it all has meaning.
I believe human beings should have faith in themselves,
and we should have faith that our lives have meaning.
We don't really know what we are at this point in history,
not collectively anyways.
They say everything in life has a silver lining,
that if you have a lot of bad things happen then something good has to come to counterbalance it.
The Taoists were the first to introduce this duality concept way before Carl Jung.
They called it yin and yang.
There had to be something I was learning at the ranch,
and something I was learning in the best possible way,
by experience.


We initially took a huge hit financially by me stopping my counseling business.
I've never gone back to counseling since that early decision on the ranch.
The few things I had done to help supplement the bills in the house,
restoring old cars and motorcycles,
mainly Triumphs and Harley Davidsons,
was good,
but I wanted to do more.
I believe in doing things. 
I believe our ideas represent our unmanifest future.
How we deal with our ideas and inspirations define our lives.
I started a non-profit animal sanctuary and took in horses that needed homes,
*Hopeful Hooves*.
We started to get horses from people who couldn't care for them anymore.
I was a little haunted by the abandoned horses in the desert.
It never really left my mind.
I wanted to find a way to ensure horses didn't end up in the desert,
horses that had been raised on ranches,
horses that were accustomed to being fed and watered.
It bothered me a lot that horses were abandoned in the desert.
So I opened the shelter with Joyce's consent,
started a small marketing campaign,
and took donations for these abandoned horses.


I don't believe in accidents.
I don't believe in coincidence.
In my book,
coincidences are almost always misinterpreted reality.
A coincidence is always trying to tell us something.
This might sound strange from a person going through what I was going through at the ranch,
but remember what I said,
I'm using my words very carefully
&mdash;
I believe experience is the best teacher.



I had a lot of time to think while I was out in my workshop.
I was constantly trying to put a picture together in my mind,
constantly trying to understand what was going on at the ranch.
My mind settled on the idea that there was a dimension right beside ours.
Things in that dimension could experience and see everything that was going on in our dimension but we could not see and experience their dimension with our five senses and mind.
However,
we had ways of knowing it was there.
There were the moods that I spoke about earlier in this story.
The incredibly negative and angry moods I would get myself into when I was at the house.
Being a former social worker who specialized in PTSD and addictions,
and being capable of self-analysis to the degree that anybody is,
I concluded that there was nothing going on in my own life that was creating these moods,
no big change in diet,
no chemical influence from the water,
and nothing that would provide any kind of a physiological connection between temperament and cause,
therefore,
I concluded that my moods were a product of living next to this dimension,
which,
for some reason,
had a much stronger presence at my ranch.
The gray aliens could affect human moods,
thinking,
and behavior.




I fashioned a working hypothesis in my head where this was the case.
There was some form of energetic reason why the ranch was such a way station or bus terminal for phenomenon from the fourth dimension.
Now,
as I said earlier in the story,
I began to do a lot of research about the extraterrestrial phenomenon.
There was no end of books to be found at used book stores in and around the Buckeye area and Phoenix.
As I said before,
it was something of a hotspot for extraterrestrial activity and discussion.
I read *Fire in the Sky*,
the Travis Walton abduction story.
However,
I remain a little bit doubtful because Walton had been a lifelong UFO enthusiast before he got abducted,
and it just seemed to me like he was poisoning the whole experience.


One of the hardest things to get my head around as I worked on the Harleys and cars in my shop,
was the idea that some portion of the dead,
the human being who had left their bodies,
who did not go to a higher and better place,
was skulking about in some kind of nether world that was populated by extraterrestrials,
and here I am referring to the young Mexican boy who killed himself himself in the house.
Perhaps absent the physical form and the biological energy we generate while physically alive,
the disembodied humans were not bothered and capable of cohabitating with extraterrestrial life in the other dimension.
In a weird way,
the whole process of life became more understandable to me living on the ranch.
This was the beginning of the dividend,
the yin and yang that the Taoists spoke about.
I began to understand that physical life was just one form of life,
and that energy never died,
as Einstein stated,
it just changed form,
and somehow,
in some way,
consciousness persisted.
An aspect of the individual persisted after the death of the physical body.
Maybe not the entire personality and all of its discernment,
but the tendencies of the being persisted after death.

As much as the experiences at the ranch were disconcerting,
to say the least,
there were some benign coincidences.
The coincidences manifested in something entirely benign, 
but I'm getting ahead of myself.
I will get to them in their proper place in this story.
In the beginning,
I would come across information that was extremely useful to me.
I remember coming across the work of Robert Monroe.
He was a pioneer in research about out of body experiences.
He documented them in a book called *Journeys Out of the Body*.
He followed that first book with two sequels,
the last being *Ultimate Journey*.
Monroe zeroed in on the concept of frequencies.
He claimed that certain sounds could create a mood in a person,
either a very good feeling or a very bad feeling.
He also believed that sound was able to create a dimensional doorway through which an aspect of the human being could leave the body.
He claimed to have done this numerous times.
His work was formalized in an institute called The Monroe Institute.
It persists to this day.
They deal with hemi-sync technology which aims to make the left and right sides of the brain operate in unison.

He also documented his journeys out of the body.
He came to the conclusion that the human race was creating energies that were consumed by non physical entities,
or entities outside of our time-space frequency.
Essentially,
he postulated that we were only at the top of the visible food chain,
but the food chain went into these other dimensions where aspects of the human being exist.
I am open to the idea of an immortal or divinely created part of the human being,
only I prefer to know something rather than believe it.

Here is the mission statement of The Monroe Institute.

>Our Mission

>The Monroe Institute advances the exploration of human consciousness and the experience of expanded states of awareness as a path to creating a life of personal freedom, meaning, insight, and happiness.

>The Monroe Institute® (TMI), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education and research organization, is a preeminent leader in human consciousness exploration. TMI is devoted to the premise that focused consciousness contains the answers to humankind’s questions. Through the use of specific binaural beat technology, education, research, and development, TMI has been advancing the experience of individuals in the exploration of targeted and expanded states of awareness for close to 50 years.


Monroe was a laughingstock in the world of psychiatry when he went public with his first book.
I commend his courage for going public.
At the time,
we were nowhere near the public discussion we have now on consciousness.
There was no new age movement,
no exopolitics,
no advanced physics postulating multiple realities,
at least not at the level of popular culture,
no books or radio shows like Coast-to-Coast,
just Monroe going public with his experiences.

I didn't have his courage,
at least not back then.
I dreaded going public with my story.
I thought about what my former colleagues in mental health would think
&mdash;
Edmonds went out to live in nature and went crazy.
We are all bound to this social consciousness to some degree.
Nobody wants to be the pioneer for fear of ridicule.
The first person out with something new and unknown is a social punching bag.
If you get big enough they'll be doing jokes about you on late night talk shows.
The absurdity of that being my fear back then is only now funny.
It took me years to get to this point.
It's funny because I had really frightening things going on
&mdash;
aliens,
violence upon my body,
my wife levitating,
assumed abductions,
and a gray alien brained with a baseball bat
&mdash;
and my fear was *what people would think*.
That's the power of social consciousness,
the group think,
the tribe.

We continued to have experience with the gray aliens.
It was as though once they were discovered they were much more likely to allow themselves to be seen,
or,
at the very least,
not as worried about being seen.
I have the feeling that a big part of the power of this fourth dimension,
or what some esoteric cartographers call the *lower* fourth,
is the fact that human beings don't know about it. 
There is a man named Jerry Marzinsky breaking new ground in mental health.
Marzinsky worked in mental health for four decades,
mainly with paranoid schizophrenics,
and much of his work was done in the penal system.
He believes schizophrenia is a lie,
that the voices are not auditory hallucinations,
and that the individuals are breached,
where breached means that the membrane around us,
what some call the aura,
is weak and entities get into the afflicted individual,
who is then placed on a regimen of anti-psychotic pharmacy that hurts rather than helps him.
Marzinsky conducted multiple non-normative interviews with incarcerated schizophrenics in which he opened the discussion with the patients to the possibility that the voices were real.
The response was affirmative.
Many of the patients confirmed what Marzinsky suspected,
and the patients began to describe a reality in which they were cohabited with groups of beings who were deceased human beings.
The rule on the other side was that the world of the living could not know these disincarnate beings were possessing the living,
who were assumed to be mentally ill.
If the human race came to the realization this was the case then the dead would be vacated from their hosts,
and that was not an outcome they wanted.
Much like the bruising and marking and branding Joyce and I went through,
many of Marzinsky's patients showed him injuries given to them while they slept.
Of course Marzinsky is a laughingstock,
but I think he's on to something,
a new frontier of human understanding that when realized and acted upon by the human race will herald a new age of mental health care.  
I too have come to the belief that there is an aspect of this fourth dimension and the inhabitants therein that relies on human ignorance.
Perhaps they have some kind of symbiotic relationship with the living that depends on the living believing they don't exist.
However,
once the secret was out at the ranch,
the gray aliens seemed far less concerned with making themselves hidden.
I started seeing them in the day more and more.
The violence and chaos in the house,
like the rattling around in the kitchen,
and the stuff disappearing,
abated for a while.
It was almost as if we'd come to some sort of a truce with them,
but it didn't last forever.


The next animal slaughter happened.
One of my most beautiful horses was eviscerated.
I found it in the stall in the morning.
It had been fine and healthy when I went to bed.
When I woke up it was just something of a husk of what it was the night before.
And again,
just like the Rottweiler,
there had been no commotion,
no sound,
no warning in the middle of the night.
This was an astounding feat for the aliens,
beyond what we humans could do.
When an animal that is part of a social group,
like dogs or horses,
is being attacked,
the rest of the group is quite vocal in their defense,
making all kinds of noise to bring some kind of aid to the situation,
lacking any other kind of recourse to stop what's going on.
Not so with the animal evisceration.
The only way I can describe it is to say that the remaining animals were narcotized somehow,
but that would be looking at the whole phenomenon from our human perspective.
Who knows what they're capable of doing from the fourth dimension.
If they could affect my mood and make me into an angry and raging lunatic in the middle of the day while being alone in the house,
what could they do to a less developed mammal like a horse or a dog?



Whatever truce might have existed between myself and these aliens,
was over after the evisceration of my beautiful horse.
I thought of nothing else other than going to war with these creatures.
A couple weeks before Christmas I was down around Phoenix,
just outside the city limits,
doing a little bit of shopping in the middle of the day.
I was enjoying a little off-ranch time with myself and two of the dogs.
I was following a pickup truck packed beyond safe capacity,
I mean the guy's truck was overflowing.
I considered calling the sheriff,
but I had enough on my plate with the ranch.
I was keeping a safe distance behind him because I was half expecting something to fall off the back of his truck.
I could see that he had a Christmas tree packed in there but the rest of the stuff I couldn't quite make out.
Sure enough,
a ways down the road,
we hit a little bump and some things were discarded from his truck.
He was completely unaware of it.
I honked my horn but he didn't stop.
I pulled over and gathered the stuff off the road.
In an unbelievable twist of fate,
one of the things that had fallen off the truck was a vintage samurai sword inside the scabbard.
I couldn't believe it.
I'm no expert on swords,
but this seemed like something that was made with some care and attention,
not a manufactured replica.
I didn't get the man's license plate and was therefore unable to call him,
but I want to assure you that I did speed off down the road and try and catch up with him to return what I considered to be a fairly costly piece of personal memorabilia that he'd lost on the road.
Buddy had all but disappeared and I couldn't find him.
So I inherited a samurai sword.



Joyce came home early that night.
There was no second job during the month of December.
I prepared a lovely meal for us to enjoy.
It was rare that we had quality alone time.
Joyce was avoiding the house.
I felt like the man the Southwest Bell installer told me about,
the guy who built the place,
the guy whose wife didn't want to live there.
The phenomenon of the house was still ninety percent experienced by me and ten percent experienced by Joyce.
She was no stranger to what was going on,
but given her relative absence from the house,
except for sleep,
there was nowhere near the same level of activity in her life.


I'd begun to avoid quiet time with my wife.
Whenever we became relaxed,
whenever we forgot what was going on at the ranch,
she asked if I had changed my mind about moving.
There was no changing my mind.
I was dug in like Butch and Sundance fighting the Bolivian Army.
I've changed a lot in the two plus decades I've been living at the ranch.
My sixty year old self doesn't agree with my thirty-seven-year-old self,
but we are who we are at each stage of our life,
and back then I was obstinate and proud.


After dinner,
we were enjoying a coffee and some small talk at the kitchen table,
when I got up to go and get what I had found on the road,
what had fallen off the pickup truck.
I walked back into the kitchen and held the scabbard out in front of me.


What's that?
Joyce asked.


I pulled the beautiful blade out of the scabbard.


Oh my God,
she said.
Where did you get that?


It fell off a truck,
I said.
