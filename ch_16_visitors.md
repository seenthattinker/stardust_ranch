If you've stayed with me so far in the story, 
I feel the need at this point to say
&mdash;
it gets weird.


Sometime around the third week in July 2011 I received a phone call.
If you've been listening to the story,
you know a lot of people call me out of the blue.
People who think they've been touched by God,
people who think they spoken to aliens themselves,
people who believe themselves to be powerful clairvoyants or psychics
&mdash;
and many really are gifted seers
&mdash;
and just regular people who have heard about my story through the play it had gotten in the exopolitics arena.
By this time I had been out in the world almost a decade.
Remember,
when I started this story I told you the most difficult part for me would be the timeline.
I've been on this ranch since June 1st 1996.
A lot of the things that I described in the early part of the book just kept repeating themselves.
I didn't want to stress that too much.
We were getting to this.
But the abductions were quite consistent.
The markings on my body were quite consistent and,
to be clear,
I killed a lot of grays.
I hated the little bastards.
It was an acute sense of territory and defense of home and family,
but that might be making excuses for myself.
I don't have a lot of regrets about killing the grays.
I don't kill them anymore.
I made my peace with the grays,
or I was allowed to make my peace with the grays.
Let me put it this way,
within all of us is a simple animal consciousness.
Sufism talks about seven souls:
mineral,
vegetable,
animal,
personal,
human,
and secret souls,
and the secret of secrets.
We all have an animal inside of us.
Put your hand into a gopher hole sometime and see if you don't get bit,
same thing for a badger.
Walk into a den of wolves and see what happens,
a cave with a jaguar in it.
Of course,
I'm not really recommending you go out and do these things.
I am of course just demonstrating the law of the home.
Defending the home is a spiritual law to my sensibilities.
Even insects have it.
Go and kick around a big ant hill sometime.
See if the ants don't bite you.
So I'm not apologizing for killing the grays.
I am however saying that it was an expression of my animal soul,
in the Sufi sense.



The person who called me in mid-July of 2011 was a new kind of weird.
She introduced herself as Doctor Brandy Howe.
She told me that a third-party had hired her to come out to my ranch and see if she could help me.
She did not at that time say who the third party was.
We talked for about five minutes.
I gave anybody who called me a serious ear for at least five minutes.
That's all the time I need to weed out the cranks.
She called herself a doctor because she healed people and animals.
She seemed to me the embodiment of everything that Arizona had come to represent in the flaky New Age world.
It's probably best to let her website speak for her.
It's called Nite Star Life Awareness,
and the landing page has the following introduction.


>Brandy L. Howe, DD, Traditional Naturopath, Life Science Practitioner, has over 30 years experience in the study of Alternative/Integrative healing.  In March, 1996, she received her Doctor of Naturopathy degree with High Honors through the Clayton School of Natural Healing.  In February, 2002, she attained Doctor of Divinity and is an ordained minister.  She is a Reiki Master/Teacher, Animal Intuitive Lightworker, Electromagnetic Practitioner, Certified Organic Consultant and a Licensed Facilitator for Joyful Child, Inc.

>Dr. Howe's studies include herbology, pharmacology, nutrition, aromatherapy, iridology, homeopathy, polarity therapy, acupressure, kinesiology, reflexology, healing, vibrational therapies and remedies, animal communication, spiritual/intuitive guidance and bereavement assistance.



We set a date for July 31st, 2011.



##Cynthia Crawford


The most curious thing about Brandy's  call was who paid her.
It was a woman by the name of Cynthia T Crawford.
In a world of strange tales,
and the world of extraterrestrials is certainly a world of strange tales,
Miss Crawford's is in the top one percent.



She was born a fraternal twin.
but she had a different blood and tissue type than her twin sister,
and,
unlike her twin sister,
she was born without an amniotic sac.
According to medical history,
this is the first time that this has ever happened.
It left the doctors more than a little bit confused,
but that was not the first time that Cynthia Crawford would baffle and confuse people.
It was in fact just the beginning of a lifetime of bafflement.
To tell Cynthia's story we have to go to the very root of the *modern* exopolitics world.
It begins in World War II.
This is not to say that extraterrestrials have not been on this planet longer than that;
they most certainly have,
and they have influenced almost every aspect of human expression,
but that's a story for a later chapter.
Cynthia's father was a member of the OSS
&mdash;
the Office of Strategic Services
&mdash;
the progenitor of the CIA.
Our engagement with the Nazis is part of an untold story in world history.
It's broken out in the world of UFO lore,
but that doesn't mean it has mainstream acceptance.
Much like Dr. John Mack trying to bring abductions to the world,
mainstream academe has done very little to introduce the idea of extraterrestrials commingling and participating with the human race in major historical events.
This is where researchers like Richard Dolan play such a strong role.
His work on the exoteric aspect of the exopolitical world has been astounding,
a breath of fresh air in an otherwise unprofessional and unstandardized world.



The Nazis were so far ahead of the rest of the world technologically that they were even creating UFOs.
They didn't dream these things up on their own.
They had help from extraterrestrials.
The story told by William Tompkins,
a retired aviation executive and extraterrestrial familiar his whole life,
affirms that the Nazi Party made an alliance with a group of Draco Reptilians,
of the Draco star system.
These are the reptilians that David Icke was laughed out of polite society for talking about in the mid-nineties with his breakout book,
*The Biggest Secret*.
Icke is telling the truth.
The Draco Reptilians have played a huge role in human history for millennia.
They are so integrated into human culture that we can hardly tell what's theirs and what's ours anymore,
especially at the level of religions.
We'll get more into the reptilians in a subsequent chapter.


Undoubtedly,
Crawford's father was privy to a lot of the early UFO secrets when the Nazis folded up and went to Antarctica.
They didn't actually lose the war.
The Nazi Party is alive and well.
The people they left behind were part of a distribution plan between Russia and the United States called *Project Paperclip*,
which is actually referenced by name in the Hollywood movie,
*Captain America: The Winter Soldier*.
Remember,
it's been the military-industrial-entertainment complex for some time. 
The cutting-edge science of the Nazi Party was distributed between the two ruling political systems in the world,
communism and capitalism.


This was the beginning of the breakaway civilization I discussed in the previous chapter.
The knowledge and science inherited from the Nazi Party was so overwhelming that secret divisions of an as of yet unnamed intelligence agency were created.
The OSS became the CIA in 1947,
with parts of the OSS continuing on autonomously for some time afterwards,
but the bulk of intelligence went to the CIA.


Cynthia's father was approached by officers of the OSS to be part of a very secret government project.
He signed back up with the army to work for the project with the OSS,
a project so secret that Cynthia herself was not told until her mid-thirties.
Her father then told her that she was a hybrid human being created in an OSS program with deoxyribonucleic acid from two different alien races combined with human DNA.




Now most people when they hear this kind of information immediately jump to a bad and evil government position.
This is the basis of an entire culture of conspiracy theory which has evolved in the last few decades,
especially spiking after September 11th, 2001,
and becoming a louder and louder voice not only in America but in other parts of the world as well.
As I said earlier in my story,
the human race has a collective unconscious,
and they can be lied to for only so long before something very disturbing starts to dominate their consciousness.
It doesn't mean that they have all the answers.
They can't go to court and make a case against the government,
but at a very fundamental level everybody knows that they're being lied to now.


Hollywood has received a lot of its ideas from the intelligence world,
and this is not just a question of keeping the public informed.
The intelligence world knows what I'm telling you.
They know we live within a collective consciousness.
By letting the information out under the classification of fiction they are able to release some of the pressure building up in the human unconscious.
It is,
as described in the earlier chapter,
a false catharsis,
an extraction of all of the negative and toxic emotions that are building up in human consciousness through a two-dimensional picture projected onto a movie screen.


They also started up the mind control and mind strengthening programs that fall under the umbrella of MK Ultra.
These were begun with the CIA through the satellite office that operated out of McGill Hospital University in Montreal,
Canada.
All of this is verifiable.
The Canadian authorities have gone through class action suits by the survivors of the original programs.
My point in bringing all of this up is that we saw something in World War II through our engagement with the Nazis that changed the way we think about our reality forever.
The only problem is that experience was not universal for the whole human race.
Had it been universal,
we might be living in a very different society now,
one humbled by the reality that we were not alone in this solar system,
the Milky Way Galaxy,
or the trillions of galaxies that exist.


So much changed in World War II that an entire history has to be written for the last seventy-five years.
The history we have now is pretty much entirely a lie except for certain spot on dates like the bombing of Dresden or the bombing of London.
The motivations for that war and the forces at play in that war have never been revealed to the human race.
Nor has it been revealed that we did not win World War II.
It just sort of ended when the Nazi establishment went to Antarctica.
You could say that the modern exopolitical world begins with what was harvested from the Nazis through Project Paperclip.
The first questions that we could ask about Miss Crawford are where did the OSS come up with two different types of alien DNA,
and why was the OSS,
which was tasked with intelligence during World War II,
the holder of alien DNA at the end of World War II?


All of these are questions I can't answer.
I'm only bringing these things into my story to help you understand the UFO phenomenon and,
at a certain point in this story,
we're going to hit the crossroads;
we're going to hit the point of this story,
and you need to understand these details,
and you need to understand when the actual exopolitical reality became such a focus of the intelligence communities in the world.


As a toddler,
Cynthia was routinely visiting medical  facilities that were run clandestinely underground by the military.
She went through a battery of examinations.
She would later recall a host of alien abductions,
examinations,
impregnations,
as well as miraculous healings and organ replacements.
For the fifties and into the seventies,
she desperately tried to understand her experiences,
but there was nothing similar being talked about in public back then.
It's sometimes difficult for us in the first quarter of the new millennium to imagine a world without the Internet and any question we have being reasonably answered in a matter of seconds,
but that was life back then.
It must have been hard for her to go through her ordeal alone,
factoring in as well her need to talk about these things and how these things would be greeted by the uninitiated.
She was very often viewed as completely insane.
She had psychic abilities.
It wasn't until she faced these otherworldly beings that she transcended her fear,
and it was then that she learned that they were in fact her family.
From that she awakened to her mission and why she had been brought to this planet in the first place.
Confused yet?
What do you think that last part means,
*why she came to this planet?*
What came to the planet?
She was born of three different kinds of DNA mixed together,
two alien and one human part.
But she claims that she came to this planet.
This is an important point in the alien narrative,
and it also is a point at which the story gets very esoteric.


Deoxyribonucleic acid has to be in frequency with the astral form that it is going to incarnate into it.
Now I need you to stop here for a moment.
So many things in our religious and spiritual traditions can be explained with the addition of the alien narrative and what it has taught us.
When the Vedic,
Buddhist,
Sikh teachers and others tell us that karma is infallible and that nobody can escape the consequences of their actions or the benefits,
they are referring to this relationship between DNA and frequency.
A frequency is a composition of thoughts and feelings.
There's probably a much better word than frequency but I can't think of it.
No matter how comfortable a dark human being seems to be with their actions,
a mafia enforcer,
a vicious police officer,
a corrupt politician,
and anyone else you can think of,
a part of them is recording everything,
and a part of them is not in concert with what they are doing.
The true nature of all sentient beings is to give.
But this has to be learned over time through incarnations.
Each and every time we live a life where we become very self-centered and damaging to the people around us,
there's a sleeping part of us that knows everything that we're doing and records it,
and when we die we are reminded of it.
When we incarnate we seek an incarnation that will rectify the imbalance.
We seek atonement.
There are no dark forces controlling us on the other side,
at least not as it pertains to the original construction of the creator.
We judge ourselves.
This is why forgiveness is such an important part of spiritual traditions.
You are literally saying you do not want to be part of a karmic cycle that is going to draw you back into circumstances in the future.
You are willing to absorb the pain and the injustice that has been done to you,
which might well be the result of an injustice you did in a past life,
and you are willing to move on.
For the greater good you forgive.
And according to Cynthia,
she came to earth on a mission of greater good.
She came here on a spiritual mission.
To fulfill that mission she had to go through all kinds of mental and physical suffering.
She chose to do all of that.
So the alien DNA was to bring her in as a spiritual being,
to bring an alien vibration into a human atmosphere.
It couldn't be done any other way.
Now stop and think for a moment about Christ.
His frequency was angelic if his father was the Archangel Gabriel.

I don't recall meeting Cynthia,
but I did.
It might have been in the early two thousands at some kind of UFO Meetup.
I had started making the rounds in the new millennium,
and my story was well known.
But I had not spoken with Cynthia for any number of years,
so long in fact that I didn't recall meeting her when I was first told it was she who paid for Dr. Brandy Howe to come to my ranch to try and aid me.


It wasn't until many years later,
2017 to be exact,
that I would see Cynthia Crawford again.
She came out to the ranch to visit me.
She had three large tumors in her brain.
She knew she was going to die.
I was one of the last people that she would see before she left this world.
She died a couple days after visiting me at the ranch. 
I am eternally grateful to this day for what she did for me.
It was such a comfort to meet her,
to have someone understand what I had been going through at the ranch,
and to better understand myself,
and why I'd gone through all the experiences I had.
We choose our lives.
We sign up for them before we are born.
A friend of mine once told me that on the other side history is written from the future backwards.
In the Sufi cosmology there should be a galactic soul,
a way of describing oneself as a being that has life in the universe,
not just the earth.
Perhaps they lacked the language.
Cynthia was a galactic soul.
Her consciousness had memory and knowledge of herself as a galactic being.
She made it abundantly clear to me my mission was to tell the world what was going on at my ranch.
It was time they knew.
I am fulfilling that promise to her and myself.
