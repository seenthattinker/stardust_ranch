Contact
==============

Some say that in this life to experience anything really good you have to experience something bad.
The laws of duality dictate that you don't even know  that something is sweet unless you have tasted bitter.
You can't really understand what beauty is until you know what ugliness is.
The same holds true for my experiences with extraterrestrials.
I couldn't really understand what a benign extraterrestrial was until I experienced malignant extraterrestrials.
After a decade and a half of a living hell with the gray aliens and the assorted weirdness at the ranch my life changed.
The visit by doctor Brandy opened a whole new book in my life. 
I had no experience with positive extraterrestrials. 
I didn't know that somebody could come to your house with two Sirians. 
It was a life-changing event. 
I became and I remain a contactee. 
A contactee, 
as already described in this book, 
is someone contacted by benign extraterrestrials. 
Benign simply means non-invasive, 
cooperative, 
and compliant with a set of laws they claim the universe operates upon. 
There are a number of famous contactees in the exopolitics world. 
They're not household names, 
far from it, 
but they are very well-known in the exopolitics world,
and, 
according to them, 
they are very well known by the governments that want to suppress the spread of extraterrestrial knowledge, 
and they are known by the negative extraterrestrials.

When Brandy and I sat in the living room,
she opened up a ball of light,
a portal she created.
From this portal emerged two more beings.
One was an Andromedan.
The other was a reptilian.
I engaged in a dialogue with them that lasted some hours.
This is not to say that some hours passed at the ranch.
Interacting with these beings changes the flow of time.
A two or three minute interaction with these beings can come to represent three or four hours of time in your mind as you unpack the information.
It's a little like a zip file  on a computer.
Once you open it up it's got much more data than it's size suggests.
The following is my account of what I was told by the positive extraterrestrials.
I should point out as well that my contact has not stopped.
It's ongoing.



##Portals


I asked what the portals were.
They told me they were doorways through time and space.
Doorways through space are quite common.
They are all over the planet.
Time travel portals that can go to the future or the past are very rare.
They wouldn't tell me how many there were on the planet.
It was like this with every topic.
They answered my questions,
but in a way that opened up a dozen new questions,
with none of the subsequent questions addressed.
There was none of the intuitive flow a conversation has with a human being.
Everything was stilted,
and it had to be pried out.

The portal on the back of my property was put where it is eight thousand years ago.
It is directly connected with Egypt,
which,
according to what the extraterrestrials told me,
was a far more expansive culture than people have been led to believe.
The portal has automatic activation times,
and it can be activated at any time by someone who knows how to operate it.

The portals are an electrical anomaly,
or,
rather,
anomalous to human beings in the reality we live,
but normal to other beings.
It was made clear to me that when a race lives in more than one dimension their sense of time is not linear.
Time moves and expresses itself differently in the fourth dimension,
the dimension where extraterrestrials live and pass through,
and a dimension many humans travel through,
either consciously by practice,
as was the case with Robert Monroe,
author of *Journeys out of the Body*,
or unconsciously when they sleep and dream.
In a sense,
it was made clear to me that a human being is a series of portals through energy centers in our bodies,
the chakra system,
but the portal on my property physically transported people.
When we travel consciously or in our sleep we are traveling in our subtle body.
It's a form similar to our physical body but lighter,
and,
from the perspective of the earth,
it's translucent,
but, 
while we are in the fourth dimension,
it's not.
It has something approximating physicality as we experience it here on the earth,
with slight differences to accommodate that dimension.

This explained much of what had been see on the ranch.
I had been sitting in the living room in the past,
had the portal open up,
and seen ancient Egypt inside,
as well as Rome and other civilizations.
I'd also had human beings come through the portal and march about the ranch for a while.
I've had native shamans and Roman Centurions. 
There's really no end to what fourth dimensional being might show up.
I was told not to use it.
In many ways the extraterrestrials viewed me as a dog,
or a horse.
I get the sense interacting with them that they don't have a high regard for our race.
I feel tolerated a lot of the time.
Again,
I'm not saying they're cold.
They have a good presence.
It is uplifting to be around them.
I just felt like a child dealing with adults.
The contextual gaps in our realities are so great they need to be factored into everything they say.





##Human Growth

One of the first things that I asked the extraterrestrials about was human growth.
I wanted to know if the growth cycle we were going through is natural.
Here I am referring to the last hundred years or so,
beginning at World War I and leading up to our present day where we seem intent on destroying ourselves and the world.
I suggested that we were about eight hundred years behind in our development due to the confines of religion during the Middle Ages.
They told me that in fact it was much worse,
that we were thousands of years behind our development cycle. 
What was particularly engaging about their dissertation was the way in which it forced me to contextualize what growth was.
The creation of a sentient life-form on a planet at the density we live at,
which we can call  three dimensional for the purposes of our context,
is the crowning achievement of the life process on a planet.
Here we need to define sentience.
It is the ability to have enough awareness to say that you exist.
We can look upon this as the philosophical self-awareness of the French philosopher, 
Descarte
&mdash;
*I think therefore I am*.
This has nothing to do with self-awareness as it is defined spiritually.
That's a whole other topic,
but,
for the purposes of this  explanation,
self-awareness is the conscious understanding that you are an individuated being,
you think therefore you are.
According to the extraterrestrials,
the first level of growth in awareness on a planet is mastery of the planet because the sentient life-form,
in the case of earth,
the human being,
is the steward of the planet.
As the steward the human being is supposed to be able to communicate with everything in visible creation.
I know,
I was slack-jawed when I heard it,
too.
We are supposed to be able to communicate with animals,
reptiles,
insects,
trees,
and everything that is living on the planet.
This is regarded as an elementary step in the evolution of a sentient being.
These things must be understood before a sentient being is allowed into the solar system and then allowed into the galaxy.
How many people do you know who can communicate with animals?
I know one,
the woman who came out to my ranch to negotiate with the rogue gray aliens.
The biosphere that we live in is all a product of the same creator that made us.
As stewards of the planet we are supposed to be listening to the other life-forms and aiding them in their  existence.
As I was listening to them I was reminded of a Hopi prophecy that stated the world would not have balance until the native peoples and the Europeans came to an understanding and appreciation of each other.
This was supposed to happen when we came to America.
Something went terribly wrong.
Rather than listen to and learn from the natives,
and vice-versa,
they listening to us and learning from us,
to create a more whole people,
we engaged in brutal warfare that has left the native population almost decimated.
The natives on the planet represent the best possible example of stewardship and communion with nature.
It's only recently that the white man and other races have begun communing more properly with the natives,
unfortunately this has to be done at a chemical level with psychedelics administered by the natives,
such as ayahuasca,
which has become quite popular in certain circles in the West and often referred to as the god vine.
Natives for their part should have adopted more advanced forms of agriculture practiced by the Europeans,
recognizing that it was egotistical of a tribal people to believe they could roam vast swatches of land and hunt a healthy population of wild,
undomesticated game.
Their model of existence did not allow for population growth.
It's a two-way street.
It's not all the evil white man or the savage Indian.
It's a failure to communicate and understand each other.
It's a failure to build a bridge and to make two cultures better and more balanced.

If any of this sounds far-fetched,
let me assure you that I watched Brandy walk around my ranch and talk to all of the individual animals and tell me what they were thinking and what ailed them.
Given that she didn't know their medical histories,
I can only conclude that she effectively communicated with them.
It's difficult for me at this point after witnessing it myself to believe that human beings are not able to communicate with animals.
Canada has produced a relatively famous ethnobotanist named Wade Davis,
who was National Geographic's explorer-in-residence for a number of years.
Some of you may have seen the film,
*Serpent and the Rainbow*,
about Voodoo and creating zombies in Haiti.
That was based on the work of Wade Davis.
Davis spent a number of years living with tribal people in the Amazon Rainforest.
He was curious to know how aboriginal cultures had come to an understanding of plants that allowed them to prepare medicines and hallucinogenics for ritual that were so complicated they would be difficult to replicate in a sterile laboratory at an Ivy League university.
The natives told Davis that the plants talk to them.


The fact that the human race has conditioned itself to acquire property and wealth is precisely what is blocking us from our growth potential.
I don't think they mean we should all become like Francis of Assisi and give away all of our possessions. 
I think what they meant was that these things should not govern us. 
We should live to eat nutritiously and have safe and comfortable shelter in our lives, 
but we should be able to let go of those things and travel and do other things in life when we need or want to.


They stressed that we need to be unencumbered on this planet, 
and by unencumbered they meant not held back by anything, 
and they stressed this quite a bit, 
telling me that when we were unencumbered we would be able to live most of the time at our most heightened state of awareness.  
This in turn would create a purposeful perception that would permit us to grow. 
Our entire lives have come to be consumed by what we own. 
The extraterrestrials explained to me that human beings seem to want to collect things, 
in a sense, 
they were telling me that human beings were hoarders. 
It's the absolute worst possible thing you can do. 
It prevents us from being able to move around freely, 
meet all kinds of new people, 
see new environments, 
and experience new things. 
They stressed the idea that our world is our wealth. 
The entire construction is a classroom.

The planet is our wealth. 
It's a living construction. 
We are part of the same life construction. 
We are at the top of the creational process on this planet. 
The way it was explained to me by the extraterrestrials, 
everything in creation has the purpose of teaching. 
All of the teaching is to bring us closer to the creator. 
At times, 
as I listened to these fellows, 
it almost sounded shamanic. 
The Hopi people say that they came to this planet through a tunnel.
I have these tunnels on my ranch.


##Institutions


Anything that is institutionally taught to us to put us on a treadmill for decades is inherently negative. 
It runs counter to the way a human being is supposed to live in accordance with our own nature.
We're not supposed to do anything except be the very best we can be and try to be happy. 
Our happiness should not be about acquisition,
it should be about process. 
We don't trust own value enough. 
We are capable of having profound spiritual growth,
and profound spiritual experience,
and we can share it with each other. 
The problem is we don't trust what we experience. 
If it doesn't have the rubber stamp of approval from a church or a university or an institution, 
we don't trust what we get from the inside. 
All of our experiences are valuable. 
The good and the bad. 
We need to learn to take those experiences and understand them for what they really are,
not to live in them forever. 
Absorb the experience and move on. 
The thing that we have the tendency to do most is not move on. 
We dwell on things too long. 
It takes us too long to process information. 
All of the information that we process is coming from the external. 


The force that is working against us for the most part is doubt. 
We don't invest in ourselves. 
We believe that somebody else is supposed to tell us who we are. 
Most people would rather believe in an authority figure or someone here who has already achieved a certain level of success. 
We don't believe in ourselves. 
When you do that the best you can become is a copy of somebody else. 
Given what we are, 
as the extraterrestrials explained it to me, 
it's the equivalent of spiritual cloning or life cloning. 
It's not an authentic way to live. 
Our life selections are a form of our consumer tendencies. 
Our children are expected to choose their lives by a certain age. 


##Hothouse

It gets worse.
Forces are working against us. 
I'm not talking about the Biblical devil, 
but perhaps something close. 
What I'm talking about here is the truth of the human race. 
We're a genetically manipulated species. 
Planet earth is a hothouse where extraterrestrial races grow what they need here and transplant it to other planets. 
There's not a lot of concern for anything other than usefulness. 
There are literally hundreds of thousands of other worlds to which human beings are transplanted. 
We're placed on a planet and put in a certain set of circumstances and given a master program and then the same sequences repeat themselves. 
This is why the Hopi creation story has them walking through a portal and coming to planet earth.

This has been done to us by races which are more aware.
The first step in advancement is not technological. 
It's a breakthrough in awareness. 
It's the realization that we are multi-dimensional beings.  
The next great advancement for the human race should be an esoteric advancement, 
a spiritual advancement, 
not an exoteric advancement, 
not another manifestation in our three-dimensional reality
&mdash;
another bloody smart phone,
a television with better resolution,
a faster computer,
or artificial intelligence.
If we don't balance ourselves we will crash and burn again,
as so many human civilizations have already,
the last being Atlantis.
I can't stress this dimensional breakthrough enough. 
It's absolutely critical that this be understood. 
Without this understanding nothing is going to change.
The seeders create a biological product, 
and they do it in accordance with whatever the climate and environment is of the planet on which they seed a *human*.
Next,
they create a context, 
and then they create a narrative.
Once this seeding is done,
the seeders walk away for ten thousand years and let the cycle take its course. 
There are very rarely any deviations from what they set up. 
The more advanced races in our galaxy have life spans that far exceed a human lifespan. 
There are extraterrestrial races who live thousands of years, 
some of them tens of thousands. 
Beyond that,
reincarnation is real,
a universal spiritual principle,
and a healthy race has recall of their primary identity,
the being that is reincarnating,
what we might call the soul.
There is no extraterrestrial creator of the soul.
This is fundamental.
It must be understood if we are to escape the hell that has been human life on this planet.
When you look at the wisdom that has visited this planet in the form of the great beings who seemed to embody a knowledge far beyond their life spans;
it's because human beings have a consciousness that relates to subtler bodies that have this longer memory.
Our very construction is transdimensional,
but we are taught that to entertain this idea is insane.
What is insane is dismissing our transdimensionality. 
For those of you who are angry or confused by what I am saying about human beings and their creation,
I fall back on the metaphor of electricity.
Nobody can define what electricity is.
It's fundamental character is beyond understanding.
We can harness it,
move it,
store it,
ration it,
and deploy it,
but it's a mystery.
Electrical engineers create transformers,
circuits,
fuses,
blockers,
and grounding systems,
all in an attempt to use electricity.
This is a one to one analogy to the spiritual nature of man.
We are the electricity created by the universe.
The bodies and genetics the extraterrestrials create are the equivalent of what the electrical engineers do.
In this metaphor the electricity is the spirit.
The spirit cannot be controlled or altered.
It just is.
the same is true for the soul.
It just is.
It comes from the creator and the creator is outside all time and space. 
It just is.
We are equal to all other sentient beings in creation.
The only difference is our evolution in this three-dimensional reality.
In that regard,
many of the beings aware of us are eons more advanced than us in terms of understanding the appendages of the soul,
the body,
the feelings,
the memory,
and the mind.
If you listen closely to what the benign extraterrestrials told me,
it's a one to one match for the spiritual teachers who have incarnated on the planet.
The cosmic brotherhood of sentient beings is aligned with the best of our spiritual teachings.


Time and time again we view the extraterrestrial phenomenon as external: 
an alien, 
a ship, 
transferred technology, 
the rogue grays at my ranch,
the portals,
and secret government files.
Most extraterrestrial contact is internal.
It's a thought we don't know the origin of or a vivid dream.


##How the World Changes

I spoke to the extraterrestrials about the state of the world and the environment. 
I wanted to know if there is any way to turn things around. 
I certainly don't believe the climate change narrative being pushed by the globalist agenda. 
It's a fraud. 
However,
we do have many problems on this planet related to overconsumption and overextraction of resources,  
like the endless wars for energy resources like oil.  
What could possibly be done? 
Time and time again I was told the same thing. 
We have everything we need to live harmoniously and sustainably on this planet. 
The only thing blocking us is our lack of belief in ourselves. 
I found this astounding.  
They told me we had been conditioned to external authority,
but internal direction was the way to harmonize with ourselves and our environment.
It was a little frustrating dealing with them.
Everything seemed to be this riddle,
like a Haiku poem.
They stressed fractals,
small communities,
experimental living,
cooperative self-government on a micro-scale,
but with self-discipline.
I thought about the hippie movement.
They were sabotaged by hedonism,
an aborted dream by lack of follow through.
Indian ashrams get it right in some measure.
The Scottish ecovillage, 
Findhorn,
is an excellent example. 
Look it up.
It's a community that is self-sustaining and focused on human development.
People who go on retreats there report many transdimensional experiences. 

What about help?
Why weren't the extraterrestrials helping us?
The answer is simple:
certain conditions must be in the human race for help to be offered.
We have to take responsibility for ourselves,
then the help will be understood.
The help is always here.
It's inside us.
We just don't listen or pay attention to our inner lives.
There are too many people in the exopolitics world asking the extraterrestrials to land,
declare themselves in our visible spectrum,
and solve all our problems with advanced technology,
but what would prevent the problems from recurring in a number of human generations?
If the thought and feeling patterns that created the problems aren't dealt with first then no solution would be lasting,
and we would be making our extraterrestrial saviors our parole officers,
and they don't want a custodial relationship with a sentient race.
Their thinking is completely different.
There's no quid pro quo,
nothing in it for them.
It is true that in the subtle worlds our lives are interconnected,
and,
therefore,
our actions on this planet affect them,
especially when we get into things like fission and fusion.
The extraterrestrial presence spikes after the nuclear bombs in the Second World War.
It also sent a signal out to the galaxy and the universe that we're here.
The human race does not tread softly,
and not all extraterrestrial races are benign.
There are things out there more frightening than the demons of our religions,
and far more disturbing and destructive than the rogue grays that terrorized Joyce and I.
The difference is between being saved and being sovereign. 
Extraterrestrials are more than willing to help us become sovereign,
but sovereignty means owning your cause and effect cycles,
learning by experience.
So when we as a race of beings,
the human race on planet earth,
say we want help,
to the extraterrestrials the first response is why are you not using the help built into you?
From their perspective,
we're dying of thirst beside a pristine mountain stream.
It's ludicrous,
but infancy is what it is,
and we are still an infant race. 

The best way forward is intentional living from the ground up.
Micro-communities that don't sabotage themselves are an excellent starting point.
Sabotage here means what the baby boomers did in the sixties. 
It has to be a disciplined approach.
This creates the environment for growth.
The next question is what is growth?
It's the movement into consciousness and the transdimensionality of our species.
It's coming to understand what spirit is in a literal way,
not the endless allegories that are the favorite of religions.
Spirit is not an allegory,
just as electricity is not an allegory.
Spirit is the breath of the creator exhaled into time and space,
and experienced by us as sound and light.
We take it like play dough and mold it into fantasies that fulfill our basest desires.
Sit quietly with your eyes closed for thirty minutes a day.
You'll see your spirit.
It's all the thoughts and feelings you've populated your consciousness with,
the things that are giving you hypertension and ulcers and cancer.
Behind the creations in your consciousness is the indiscriminate,
unconditional spirit from the creator,
the first sound,
if you will,
and remember sound is movement.
We live in a sound and light universe.
Light is really a form of sound.
The primary quality of the creator is sound.  

What would happen in the internal world of a human being in which desire was muted?
What pictures would take the place of the aforementioned fantasies of most human beings?
Object pictures is the answer.
You would have elementary clairvoyance.
Extraterrestrial contact is not just disks and dead aliens and my ranch.
It's also dreams and visions.
To understand it all you need to understand what the mystics have been trying to tell us as well,
people like Jacob Bohme,
Rumi,
and Zoroaster,
to name a few.
In classical Western philosophy we define the subjective and objective as the internal and external.
The things that happen inside our heads and the things that happen in the world.
This is erroneous.
The real definition of subjective and objective is our creations and the creations of others,
including extraterrestrials and the spiritual governors
&mdash;
the gods
&mdash;
and the creator itself.
Nothing human beings invent is original.
Creation is finished.
It was finished the moment it began,
because it started outside of time and space,
therefore,
anything we create is only a manifestation in our three dimensional reality of something already created,
if only in the universal mind as a concept laying dormant in the consciousness of a developing species like human beings. 
So what do we strive for?
What exactly makes life worth living?
Our goal is to become the best we can be.
Learn as much as we can.
Grow as much as we can.
The final stage is internal.
Our external form is fixed,
unless the fundamental components of our reality change,
like gravity,
the force of the sun,
or if we decide to live underground,
to name a few.





The way forward for us are independent communities where human beings define their own growth,
their own environment,
their own limitations,
away from the crippling influence of an overly institutionalized world
&mdash;
the literal and diametric opposite of the direction the self-serving power structures controlling the world are taking us.
It's going to take courage,
but courage is a foregone conclusion for survival on this planet going forward.
It takes courage to stand against tear gas in a yellow vest protest in Paris.
It takes courage to fight a superior invading army that wants your resources yet convinces the world they're liberating you from tyranny. 
It takes courage to live fully in a world where institutional propaganda conditions you to believe the world is ending.
There's no option left but courage,
so why not make it active courage rather than reactive courage?
Why not create your own life?
Why not turn your back on the herd and graze alone?
Is that not what the freedom of the West has always represented?
The benefit of the *economies of scale* created in the twentieth century are lost if there is no equitable distribution of the wealth created.
Complete state control to arrest the hoarding of the rich is not a solution.
It inhibits the freedom of expression that makes a human life meaningful.
That leaves self-defined living,
people returning to land to sustain themselves.
This mitigates the pollution of transportation.
People don't realize that eighty percent of the world's oxygen comes from plankton in the oceans.
The American poultry industry sends chicken to China to be gutted and cleaned and then sent back to American supermarkets
because the labor is so cheap it's a net profit for the corporate agriculture industry in the United States.
Yet their propaganda convinces you to pay a carbon tax for using gasoline.
Why have governments not come up with any taxing incentive or actuarial calculations that assess the environmental damage as part of the total cost of production,
as in the China chicken cleaning example?
Because our governments are not involved in solving any problems.
They're involved in demonizing us for their failures.
Why is the burden for man-made climate change being taxed at the consumer level and unchallenged at the corporate level?
The opportunity has never been greater for ecovillages because the incentive is so high. 
Continuing to live in the macro-models of western democracies is killing the planet,
and no level of carbon taxing will turn it around. 
Extraterrestrial contact going forward is going to be with individual human beings and small groups.
First contact was with governments,
and they used everything given to them for their own benefit and power,
not solutions for the people.



##Spiritual Teachings


We have outgrown all our religions.
There are some spiritual paths still useful on the planet,
but we need to stop thinking in terms of liberation.
The Dalai Lama claims a mission of rescuing all sentient beings from this planet?
Why?
If we think of our world as a prison then it is a prison.
The extraterrestrials told me our spiritual goals are conjoined with our planet. 
The earth is our classroom.
It is within us to create longevity.
A longer physical life will produce more wisdom.
Transhumanism is not the way to go.
Augmenting ourselves with tech hacks to our biology would be catastrophic.
It would further mute our connection with the creator.
They stressed over and over again that we have everything we need. 
I'm not quite sure I understand completely what they meant.
They told me that we don't understand what imagination is,
especially unpolluted imagination,
which is imagination connected to awe and wonder, 
forcing questions.
They told me that by creational law all questions must be answered,
and therefore every question is its own answer.
The question is more important than the answer.


At no point in the history of the human race since we began recording it in this cycle
&mdash;
about 8,000 years ago
&mdash;
have we been able to create a livable human environment,
a place where people can live and not dream of a better place like heaven.  
This is not to be confused with thinking about death and what happens to a human being after death. 
That's completely natural. 
From the extraterrestrial perspective there is no such thing as death.
There's only the translation from one form to another. 
Reincarnation is the universally accepted spiritual paradigm. 
It's only in an incarnate form that we can fully realize everything in creation from the bottom to the top. 
All creatures in creation seek to have a body. 
The religions of this planet are escape plans. 
All of our philosophers,
sages,
prophets,
and spiritual masters have told us the same thing time and time again: 
this planet is a living hell and we need to get out of here. 
I don't disagree that this planet is a living hell,
but it's our hell,
and only we can turn it into the kind of place that allows us to stop fantasizing about heaven.


Every aspect of human character has been designed and cultivated in this limited dimension in which we exist. 
The idea of cruelty, 
the idea of kindness, 
the idea of honor, 
all of them human constructs to survive in this dimension at its present frequency and its present reality. 
We assume that our values carry out into the universe,
that they are in fact universal. 
This is not the case.



We ask ourselves,
how could we be treated so badly? 
The first and most obvious answer is we treat ourselves this way. 
It doesn't matter what the influences are.
The influences are part of the lesson.
Everything that comes about is meant to come about.
Tragedy does not exist in higher order civilizations.
It's a human construct.
Tragedy is spiritual pornography from the extraterrestrial perspective.
It is the perversion of the normal.
So much of our pain stems from our misunderstanding of life and death.
If we understood death was only a transition we would understand how to live.
Life and death are intertwined.
Life is the projection of events from another dimension.
Some of our spiritual teachings explain this,
but it is generally withheld from the human race on this planet.
In the grand cosmology human life is about as revered as we revere a cockroach's. 
The disparity in consciousness and reality between the human race and some of these extraterrestrial races is so enormous it's like looking at two different orders of life. 
I'm not trying to speak negatively about the human race.
It's simply that we have to accept a reality. 
All life started out the way that we started out. 
The extension of life into the hundreds and then thousands of years is a quantum leap in terms of consciousness. 
Many of these extraterrestrial races look like us. 
They all follow the basic DaVinci form 
&mdash;
man is the measure of all things. 
there is often a head,
two arms,
two legs,
and a torso. 
Most of the beings have two eyes,
a nose,
a mouth,
two ears,
what the Taoists call the seven orifices above the neck,
denoting an order of creation. 
Besides that there's absolutely nothing we have in common. 
Imagine a single human being alive for the last eight thousand years of history in one body. 
That human being would have been around to see everything that happened,
If there had been one human being on the planet for the last eight thousand years we would have a complete and total understanding of what has happened on this planet.
What would it be like to talk to a human being like that? 



##Conquering Fear

One of the things that the extraterrestrials stressed with me is the role fear plays in a given life. 
They describe fear as an absolutely useless emotion.  
Fear grounds consciousness.
It exists in such great measure in human beings because we have not yet conquered death.
Death is the baseline for all fear.
It corrupts our imagination,
and the imagination is a portal to other dimensions.
Remember,
all of creation is finished.
It was finished the moment it began.
Imagination is the place we view unmanifest reality,
but that reality is corrupted by our fear.
We are co-creators with creation.
This is the meaning of human life.
If fear is allowed to create in our imaginations then reality is corrupted,
both the manifested and unmanifested realities. 

They also told me that we neither understand nor use our imaginations correctly.
The imagination is a communication tool between a human being and creation,
and it is a whiteboard for our own creative processes.
Ask any creative writer where their stories come from and they'll tell you they don't know.
Or they'll defer to some amorphous entity like the *muse*.
The same thing for scientific breakthroughs.
Often the scientist can't really explain the breakthrough or how it happened.
Creativity is the only thing artificial intelligence will lack.
Our creativity is our connection with the creator,
and the imagination is the language.

This becomes a critical understanding in extraterrestrial contact as well.
Much of it happens in consciousness.
Remember the academic reckoning between John Mack and his nemesis,
Susan Clancy at Harvard?
What was at the root of that dispute?
The legitimacy of extraterrestrial contact and abductions.
Mack postulated the experiences were real.
When he says real he means *objective* experiences that need to be studied.
What did Susan Clancy do?
She put the experiences back in the box of the mind.
In her analysis they were childhood trauma distilled into stories fueled by human desire,
in her analysis the desire to believe you were special,
that extraterrestrials had contacted you.
She made them *subjective* experiences.
What the extraterrestrials stressed with me was that there really is no subjective and objective when the imagination is properly understood.
This explains things like talking to animals and plants,
as Doctor Brandy Howe and Wade Davis,
the ethnobotanist,
explain.

Dreams are another aspect of our consciousness we don't understand yet.
Active dreaming is visualizing.
Passive dreaming happens when we sleep.
Both are us communicating with our transdimensional selves.
We have been taught to regard ourselves as ego structures.
The ego,
according to the extraterrestrials,
is a psychic scab.
Just as the skin will grow a scab when cut,
so too does the psyche. 
We call it our ego.
The problem is we don't let go of it when we're supposed to let go.
We keep the psychic scab in place by never letting it heal,
by constantly picking at it,
by engaging our trauma long after trauma has ended.
The bigger the trauma the bigger the ego.
We've actually developed a culture around trauma in the West.
This has tremendously weakened us.
It's the equivalent of constantly breaking a bone when it's almost set and healed.
We actually prefer to limp rather than walk at the level of consciousness.
Why are so many of our soldiers committing suicide when they return from deployment?
How does the Taliban treat PTSD?
They don't.
It doesn't exist in their culture.
It's as if we invite the weakness into our lives by constantly picking at the scabs on our consciousness. 



##Symbiotic Living

There is a tremendous danger in this radical self-involvement in the West,
especially now,
this moment in our timeline.
It prevents us from living symbiotically with the earth and the other life forms here.
This is the biggest crisis in the world right now.
It's not to be confused with man-made climate change,
which is a hoax.
It's about not separating ourselves from the world.
Our consciousness is individuated.
This is true,
but this does not negate the fact that we are of this world while we are here.
The world actually lends us the resources for an incarnation
&mdash;
air,
earth,
fire,
water,
and ether,
which is the fifth element,
and the one that has been held back from public knowledge.
Ether is the portal element,
the one that allows us out of this three-dimensional reality into the other worlds.
It goes by many names,
prani to the Vedics,
chi to the Taoists,
ether in the Western mystery schools.
That aside,
the earth is the repository for the elements which compose our bodies,
the vehicles we exist within when in this world.
Our modern outlook has allowed us to forget this.
The scab we have over our psyches,
those egos we all pick at,
they separate us from this basic understanding,
and in this ignorance we are doing more and more damage to the ecosystem that allows us to exist.
Eco comes from the Greek oeco,
which means household.
We are destroying our home,
and because our bodies are an aspect of this home,
we are poisoning them as well.
It's epidemic now.
This awe inspiring interlinking of life we call the earth,
completely symbiotic in its existence,
is breaking down because we reject the symbiosis and imagine ourselves floating above it.
It's the madness of ego.
It cuts us off from symbiosis.
Humility is required for symbiosis,
and the ego is the antithesis of humility.

Everything in creation is self-regulating.
The creation operates on fundamental principles.
If they are violated warnings are given,
but if the warning is not heeded then the consequence is a surprise.
If the separation from creation,
the planet,
continues in the human race,
we will be culled.
There's no way around it.
The system is conscious.
The earth is conscious.
Everything in creation is endowed with consciousness.
Do you really for a moment believe it doesn't know we're the problem?
We are at the top of manifest creation in this dimension,
but we are expendable.
Nothing is bigger than the creation except the creator.


Other races will not interfere in this process.
There will be no rescue,
and if there was then we would forfeit our autonomy.
We would become the wards of another people,
another race.
Benign races don't want that.
The creation was not set up for species daycare.
All consequence is paid in full by the party that started the sequence.
Karma is a valid universal law.
The energy that sustains our reality and all the dual realities above it,
the sound and light from the creator,
is conscious.
Everything is recorded.
It's literally impossible to avoid consequence.
It can be bartered,
transferred,
or delayed,
just like financial debt,
depending on the mood of the lender,
but it cannot be forgotten and it cannot be dissolved. 
We are responsible for every thought,
deed,
and action as individuals and as a collective,
whether that collective be a family, 
a community,
a nation,
a region,
or the human race as a whole,
and all is set in motion through the universal powers.
We get what we ask for,
and pretending we didn't understand what we were asking for is not a suitable deferment. 
This is the way the universe has been set up.
We have to be sincere in what we are doing.
There's no such thing as being alone,
not after what I've experienced.
You're not alone in the world,
even when nobody is around you,
and you're not alone in your head because there is no *in your head*.
Consciousness is a geography,
internal and external,
and that's just in the worlds that adhere to what we think is time,
after those consciousness just is.
This is where the extraterrestrials come from,
whether they finally appear in a flying disk or walk through a door of light that opens up on your ranch.



##Mixed Genetics


Earlier in this chapter I referred to this human race as a hothouse race.
The earth is a hothouse,
a nursery of sorts.
We are not natural creations.
We are of mixed extraterrestrial races.
This genetic construction applies to the physical and psychic makeup of mankind.
The spiritual is the same through all life,
whether it be an advanced galactic people like the Andromedan races,
who live thousands of years in a single lifetime,
or the mineral and insect life on our planet.
The spiritual is the same for everything.
There is no better or worse,
bigger or smaller,
richer or poorer.
Those qualities only exist as physical and psychic attributes.
The mind and access to it is the great divider.
An individual mind is an expression of a universal mind.
The human race expresses a very low percentage of the universal mind.
The mind is a field.
It exists external to us but we experience it internally because we have not unified the objective and the subjective yet.

The extraterrestrials stressed that this is not a judgment upon us.
Sentient life at the fist level of self-awareness 
&mdash;
I think therefore I am
&mdash;
requires time to grow.
All growth cycles in the development of a species are long and merciless.
The creator allows the process.
Limited awareness creates concepts like tragedy in the collective consciousness,
but that is just a baby step.
At some point in the history of this species we will fly.
All species I have dealt with have gone through their developmental generations.
These processes take time,
a time on scale with the life of a planet,
longer even,
as many species need to be moved from planets.
Movement does not take place in our physical form.
It takes place in the sensory body,
what some call the astral body.

Many of the scriptures on the planet reference alien races as gods.
The blue gods of the Vedics are a race.
Shiva is an extraterrestrial.
The Abrahamic lineage refers to the Elohim.  
They too are an extraterrestrial race. 
The genome on this planet is a protected investment.
What it was created for I cannot say because I was not told.
Why is anything created?
Why do we create children on this planet?
The reasons are the same,
just on a different scale.
Creation for an advanced race is at the level of a new sentient hominid. 
Creation for us is sons and daughters.
Both are done with love and reverence for that which created and allows creation.
Everything is a celebration of creation.


The human race is a multicultural experiment.
We represent that in our earthly cultures as well.
We're not just different in skin color and language
&mdash;
we're different at psychic levels as well,
but we are one race,
the human race,
sharing a collective consciousness,
a history,
a planet,
and a goal of growing into the promise of our creators.
We were created to answer questions,
to push the narrative of life to new understanding.
We are loved.
Higher love is not sentimental.
It might even seem cold to us.
It took me some time to get used to it.


Technology exists in the extraterrestrial races to remediate every problem on earth,
air,
water,
soil,
radiation
&mdash;
everything.
We do not demonstrate a character where this is likely,
though.
This is what I meant by cold love.
Cosmic law dictates we assume responsibility for ourselves.
This does not contradict what I said earlier about increased extraterrestrial contact with human beings.
It's just not going to happen at the level of planetary involvement.
It will take place in the consciousness of individuals and small groups to foster new ways of thinking and living.
The consequences of the choices we have made in the last one hundred and fifty years will not be abated.
We will have difficult times to live through. 


##History of Mankind

We are much older than anthropology,
archaeology,
and history suggest.
The extraterrestrials have not given me a complete history,
but there have been many seedings.
Each time we repeat the same mistakes and roll back the human race to a remnant population and rebuild.
In these rollbacks we lose everything,
our history,
technology,
knowledge,
and culture. 
Creation is not the least bit sentimental.
The goal of all life is to close the circle between the creator and the creation,
to allow the creator to experience what we experience.
This is accomplished by merging the consciousness into the creator.
The characteristics of the creator are pushed into the densest dimensions of creation through the sentient life forms that exist there.
In a sense,
there is no duality.
There is only absence.
Darkness doesn't exist.
There is only an absence of light.
Evil doesn't exist.
There is only an absence of good.
The dualistic composition of our physical,
emotional,
and mental lives is part of the education sewn into the existence in this very dense dimension in which we live.
The higher one goes in consciousness the simpler the creation and its operating principles are.
The creation is not here to deceive us.
We deceive ourselves. 

The last great age of man was Atlantis.
It lasted for tens of thousands of years.
Everything functioned at higher levels.
The technology was equivalent to what we have today but done differently.
The foundation was different.
It was a human society deemed suitable for planetary coexistence.
We had open contact with extraterrestrial races.
We developed advanced esoteric knowledge of a spiritual and magical nature.
Something went horribly wrong.
The Atlanteans attacked the Lemurians and destroyed them,
but not before the Lemurians were able to counter strike.  
It was mutual assured destruction,
sheer lunacy,
the death wish woven deep into our memory,
a pattern we repeat time and time again.

The forces of karma are merciless.
We live the same psychodrama over and over again,
in small and large scale.
Nobody is beyond it.
The northern native bands of Canada and the United States degenerated into generations of fighting around the eleventh century.
It degenerated into cannibalism and all manner of disrespect for the human being.
They were able to pull themselves out of it through the effort of one man,
who they called the peacemaker,
a prophetic figure in their history.
From this came the Iroquois Confederacy,
the first expression of interlinked state diplomacy the world had seen,
and the model for the republic the United States would become.
So much of our growth is based in violence and pain.
The case could be made we don't know any other way.

We were also a different being in Atlantis.
We had more than two active strands of DNA.
We don't really understand DNA yet as a culture.
There may be some pockets of understanding in the undisclosed scientific communities that now abound in the world,
the bastard offspring on the clandestine Nazi science,
but as a people we don't understand DNA yet.
DNA is exoteric and esoteric.
It operates in several dimensions at once,
what spiritual language might call the astral and the causal dimensions atop the physical.
Encoded in DNA is ancestral memory,
cellular memory,
and the unmanifest events of a new life,
hard as this is to believe.
Free will is an illusion that happens as a result of our limited consciousness while alive.
It doesn't really exist,
or,
rather it exists but it's not what we think it is.
It more comes down to a simple binary decision
&mdash;
forgive or collect.
It's no accident that our spiritual teachings on this planet focus on debt and forgiveness.
If the collections of karma are not made then the lessons risk being lost,
but,
at the same time,
forgiveness allows the practitioner to gain new spiritual equity,
new liberation from the clumsy cycles human beings create,
and more grace.
Many times when a human being is possessed by the spirit of retribution there is a blindness that comes about.
Once the retribution is enacted,
there is a return to clarity,
and they are as horrified by what they have done as anybody else.
They understand what they have done,
the madness and inhumanity of it,
and the act of forgiveness can bring spiritual equity to all parties.

Our most esoteric spiritual teachings are carried over from Atlantis.
They had a different base for their technology and it was more focused on consciousness.
They understood many things.
Their knowledge was carried over in Sumer.
This is the longest lasting post-flood human civilization.
It persisted with one language and culture.
The Atlantean culture persisted in some forms in Sumer,
including the remnant of extraterrestrial contact.
They had technology and metaphysical understandings not openly understood today.
The Atlantean secrets migrated from the demise of Sumer to the birth of Babylon,
where they were preserved in enough measure to pass on what would become the Egyptian religions,
their relics sought all over the world to this day,
and from Egypt there is a kind of knowledge-diaspora.
From here it moves into Greece and Rome,
and from Rome into Europe and Byzantium,
and into the Middle-East,
but not since Sumer has it been public.
It has been preserved in secret doctrines in secret societies.
It is a metaphysical geography which understands the energy of the planet,
the grid lines,
and the portals,
like the ones on my property.
They understand the transdimensionality of our species.


##My Contact

Once you are contacted by extraterrestrials they never leave you.
They become tied to your life in a mysterious way.
Just when you forget about them they reappear.
Sometimes the appearance can be quite dramatic.
They manifest right in front of you.
It's hard to explain.
It's different than the grays appearing,
which still happens from time to time,
but they have stopped all harassment. 
The benign extraterrestrials are simply not there one moment and there the next.
There is no process of materialization. 

People ask me to describe them.
They could easily pass as human,
but,
at the same time,
there's something very distinct about them.
They seem too perfect in some ways,
like Hollywood people,
the hair and teeth,
the physical bearing,
all of it makes them stand out.
If you were in a conference room at a hotel,
you would notice them among hundreds of other people,
but not in such a way that you'd know they're not of this world.
You'd just register something distinct.

I wouldn't call them warm,
not the way we describe warm.
They don't indulge their emotions the way we do.
Everything just is.
They seem to be operating from this perspective that transcends the fallacy of free will.
They know what the correct thing to do is in any situation based on the creational laws,
and they don't deviate.
It gives them a kind of mechanical countenance.
The energy around them is positive.
It's not unpleasant to deal with them,
just different,
not human.
All of their words are spoken with extreme care in their selection.
It just is sums it up fairly well.


They crossed my life through Brandy Howe,
and in that crossing they continue to present themselves.
In some ways they seem distant.
From my perspective we're talking about the future of the human race,
our planet,
it's environment,
and critical things.
When they speak back it's like they're explaining the warranty on a new car
&mdash;
very matter of fact.
Nothing seems to rile them.
Their emotional constitution seems vastly different than ours.
I don't want to characterize them as insensitive.
They are anything but insensitive.
They can feel and intuit what I want to talk about before it forms in my mind.
It's just the complete and total absence of any kind of reactive nature.
Everything just is. 
God help you if you react to anything with what I would describe as the human sense of how things operate,
which they regard as childish and entitled.
They do not tolerate it well at all.
Interacting with them has taught me a new sense of decorum.
