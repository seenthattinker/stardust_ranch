Mortal Combat
================

The greatest revelation I had at the ranch was that human beings are not alone.
The human mind is the enforcer of reality,
but it's not always accurate.
The mind is excellent for giving us the basic facts of where we live.
Our mind tells us what we can and cannot do.
It sets the primary laws of physics for our bodies as we exist in this three-dimensional reality.
All of our sciences are based on memory,
sequencing,
foundation,
and conceptualization,
but there are things that we experience in which the mind operates as an obstacle not an aid.


If I say to you that we are not alone as sentient beings in this fluid reality,
you might believe that you're capable of accepting that,
but really you're not.
None of us are.
The mind enforces its reality.
It can engage things outside its reality as concepts.
Concepts precede experience.
They are models of reality not yet experienced. 
Sentiment is a concept of feeling,
not the feeling itself.
The American poet Wallace Stevens said, *Sentimentality is a failure of feeling*. 
In my thesis here, 
concepts are a failure to experience. 
Gray aliens phasing in and out of reality is something the mind will deny.
The eyes can see it,
but the mind will still deny it.
The mind requires a context.
It's almost like a database.
Databases require the structured query language (SQL) to communicate.
The mind has its own unspoken language based on habits,
norms,
and concepts.
The language of the mind is context.


If you have an experience that the mind has no language for,
the mind can't process it.
It doesn't go into the database.
I know this sounds harsh,
but it's the truth.
We've all seen things put right in front of us that we have not been able to assimilate.
It happens every day.
Psychiatry and psychology are schools of medicine.
However,
The vast majority of the psychology used by our society is used to manipulate and harm human beings.
It was Sigmund Freud's nephew,
Edward Louis Bernays,
who started the first public relations firm on Madison Avenue in New York.
When you stop and think about this it's clearly immoral. 
Psychiatry and psychology fall under the Hippocratic Oath,
which is do no harm.
The oath does not actually say those words.
They are a colloquial summation of the oath,
but they are correct in spirit.
Manipulating you into buying something that you do not need,
that is not good for you,
that is not good for the environment,
that is not good for the human civilization on this planet,
is doing harm.
A case could be made that psychiatry has done the most harm to the human population of all the sciences in the twentieth century because it allows human beings to do things without realizing what they've done.

Bernays wrote the in his main work, *Propaganda*:


>The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, and our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of…. It is they who pull the wires that control the public mind.


Part of our evolution as a civilization has pitted two competing schools of mind control against each other. 
One is the government and one is the private sector,
the world of banking and commerce.
The private sector is telling us to buy all kinds of crap we don't need that pollutes the environment and encourages us to feel a certain way about ourselves.
The government is coming in and saying that we need to reduce what we consume and that we need to be concerned about the environment which is becoming increasingly polluted.
I certainly don't agree with climate change.
My understanding is that most of the climate change is cyclic and related to the sun.
However,
I do believe that human beings have started to live in an unnatural way and this unnatural way of living,
begun in the western world,
has now spread to the four corners of the world,
and any population capable of undergoing the rigors of being mentally entrained in the university system that we pioneered
&mdash;
engineering,
chemistry,
biology,
medicine,
computer science
&mdash;
are now producing societies as toxic as ours.
The accumulated toxicity is becoming more than the world can bare.
Even in the world of salvation there are a whole bunch of misdirects.
We've all had our attention put on the rainforests.
Sure,
they are important,
but they're not the big player.
Eighty percent of the human race's oxygen comes from the plankton in the oceans.
Our oceans are being destroyed and that oxygen supply is being depleted.

Those of you who think a *Green New Deal* is the way to go,
let me point out that the cadmium in the batteries we use is the main pollutants killing the plankton in the oceans.
The mineral components of electric car batteries are another environmental catastrophe waiting to happen.
In my estimation the problem is the culture of convenience that crept up about a hundred years ago.
The United Nations is now telling us that the only way to survive is to move into mega-cities under the auspices of Agenda 2021 and Agenda 2030.
We can certainly see this going on now.
The mega-city has become the new norm in the world
&mdash;
New Delhi and its suburbs,
Mexico City and its surrounding area,
The greater Chicago area,
The greater Toronto area.
Tokyo
&mdash;
but all of these city states require massive transportation,
energy,
and they create massive physical and mental pollution.
They are the palette upon which the ideological descendants of Edward Bernays paint our context,
which,
in my analogy,
means control of our minds.
The natural way for human beings to live is spread out in smaller communities with human beings having a certain amount of space and nature around us.
It was completely unnatural to jam us all into condominiums that go up into the sky in these dense and dark cities.
In most of these North American and European mega-cities now,
the cost of a bachelor condominium is somewhere close to a half a million dollars.
You could buy a trailer of equivalent size and ten acres of land with a water supply for one tenth the cost,
yet the latter is regarded as a moron and the former is regarded as sophisticated.
The condominium is a good economic investment.
The trailer in nature with clean water is a good life investment.
It always seems to come down to money or life.
The city also makes us extremely susceptible to all of the government's hijinx,
which,
from my experience,
is no less malevolent than the extraterrestrials themselves.
We are being pastured like cattle.
They use salt licks and some grains to get the cattle in the pasture.
They use our desires against us to get us into the the cities,
the human pastures.




We live under the belief that only our actions define us to other people and other beings and entities in reality,
but the ranch told me that is not true.
Whatever we human beings are,
we straddle a number of realities,
the first and most prominent being our physical existence,
defined by our actions and our speech,
but our interior lives are also part of a landscape that in its own way is public to these entities and beings,
in the same way that our words and actions are visible and understandable by our fellow human beings in this three-dimensional reality we call our world.
There is no privacy in evolved consciousness.
Everything we think and desire is visible on these other dimensions.
Everything we fear is known to them.



That was a gigantic step forward for me as a human being.
I am eternally grateful to the ranch for teaching me this.
The moods that I would get into were set off by an influencer that was not physical.
Whatever these entities are at the ranch
&mdash;
the disincarnate human beings,
of which we surely had more than one,
and the aliens,
of which we had only encountered the grays at this point
&mdash;
they had the ability to communicate in the human interior.



The only place I ever encountered anything even approximating the psycho-spiritual-material reality I was experiencing at the ranch was in the work of Carlos Castaneda,
the infamous *nagual* of the southwest immortalized in a series of books.
In fact,
to this day,
Castaneda is the most accurate literature not directly about gray aliens that described what was happening to me at the ranch.
Castaneda died in 1998.
His work has been packaged into *Tensegrity*,
a series of courses that can be studied from the comfort of your mega-city condominium for monthly installments.
It's a disgrace,
like almost everything the money hungry ideological children of Edward Bernays create with their distortions and manipulations.



##The Duel


I put the samurai sword under the bed in the master bedroom.
The days of baseball bats were past me.
It was a blood sport now.
The line in the sand was the beautiful horse they destroyed.
In my reading on animal mutilations,
they usually took place in pastures.
As I said earlier in this story,
the farmers would go out in the morning and find a dead animal.
In my case they did it right inside a stable.
I had the distinct sense that what was done to my horse was done to traumatize me.
It was done to intimidate me.
It was done as an act of confrontation.
I received the message.



I started to see the grays in all of their various stages.
It is really one of the more remarkable things I've ever seen,
watching them come from wherever they come from into our reality.
Imagine someone peeking out from behind a shower curtain so that all you can see is their face.
That's how the grays peeked into our reality at the ranch before they fully stepped into it.
You would either see just the face or the head poke through and no body.
I would be sitting on the sofa watching television with Joyce,
and I would catch out of of my peripheral vision one of the grays peeking through.
If I saw them they didn't step through.
A few times I saw them peek through,
without them seeing me,
then I saw them step through.
I can only describe it as some kind of real-world computer-generated interface,
it was so astounding to watch.



Since the baseball bat to the head incident in the master bedroom,
the grays had been less finicky about materializing.
Once the code is broken,
once a human being knows what's going on from this three-dimensional reality,
they're not so big on keeping the secret anymore,
and they really don't care if you see them.
I'm not saying they go out of their way to be seen;
it's just that they seemed a lot less preoccupied with being caught in the house.

I was in a constant state of vigilance.
I had connected the change in pressure around me to the proximity of the grays,
even if they had not materialized yet.
I had learned how to control my thinking and not allow the influence of these entities to set me into a negative mood.
I was looking for a confrontation.
I considered the samurai sword to be an act of providence,
some great act of fortune,
the universe telling me to go to war,
so I soldiered.


I do apologize for not being able to remember the dates,
but remember that this is a story that spans two and a half decades for me.
I believe this encounter was sometime around 2007.
The story unfolded for me in major events.
Once the event happened
&mdash;
the lights in the sky,
the disappearing items around the house,
Joyce levitating,
the marks on our bodies,
the animal mutilations,
&mdash;
it became a normal part of our experience at the ranch.
The only exception was the Men in Black.
They came a second time,
but they did not become a regular occurrence at the ranch. 

One day I was home alone.
Joyce was at work.
I was comfortably nestled into the sofa with a Pepsi,
a Triumph motorcycle gas tank,
and several grades of sandpaper.
I had machines in the shop to do the grinding,
but when it got down to the final work I liked to do it by hand.
So sometimes I would just set up camp in the living room,
lay down some newspaper to catch the grit the sandpaper took off,
and relax in front of the television while I did some of the finer work on the motorcycle restoration.


I felt the pressure change around me.
They were close by,
but not yet visible.
It was at these times that I would maintain absolute calm.
The key was not to give them any emotional or mental indicators that you were aware of their presence.
I had been working on this mental and emotional training for months.
It was a Zen state of mind.
I do believe they could pick up thought patterns if not outright read minds.
Staying calm and focusing on what you were doing and acting like nothing was going on,
including even your thinking processes,
was key to success.
I used my peripheral vision to glance around me.
I changed the channel on the television to make them think that I was unaware.


Sure enough they appeared.
I saw the first one poke his head out.
They were in the sun room,
a little glass room we had off to the side of the house.
I had a clear line of sight from the living room sofa.
It was about thirty feet away.
I casually stood and walked to the bedroom.
I bent down and grabbed the samurai sword from under the bed.
I placed it on the inside of the door frame to the master bedroom.
I then went back to the sofa and casually resumed what I had been doing,
changing the television channel once again.
This was all part of my cover.
A couple minutes later I saw three of them phase into the sunroom.
I didn't move right away.
I didn't look back,
not even with my peripheral vision.
After waiting about ninety seconds,
I got up and went back to the bedroom.
I grabbed the samurai sword.
I went down a hallway that hid me.
It would bring me out right at the sunroom without them seeing me coming.
I unsheathed the sword.
I glanced around the corner and the three grays were inside the sunroom.
The sunroom screen door was open.
I could charge right in with the sword and swing.
I took a slow deep breath through my nostrils and charged.
My stroke was perfect.
I cut the head clean off one of the grays.
The other two dematerialized immediately.




It turns out that they cannot dematerialize with their heads cut off.
I had pummeled them with baseball bats,
put bullets in them,
and stabbed them in the past,
but nothing had prevented them from phasing out of my reality,
out of my reach,
and safe from my wrath.
The samurai sword changed all of that.
Like some cheesy subtext in a horror movie,
they were killed by chopping their heads off.
I should point out at this juncture,
that they always appeared in threes.
There seemed to be one principal and two subordinates.
I killed the principal.
The two subordinates disappeared.
This was a major error for a race of beings that wanted to maintain anonymity.
I say that they wanted to maintain anonymity because if it were anything else,
the whole world would know they exist by now.
So we can safely assume that part of their mission is clandestine,
just like the occupying entities in the schizophrenics detailed by Jerry Marzinsky.
They don't want their existence on this planet,
or whatever sub plane frequency they exist next to us,
becoming common knowledge in the human race.
They do not want the collective consciousness of the human race working on them as a problem.
Secrecy is part of their mandate.
When I severed the gray aliens head,
part of that secrecy was destroyed.


I picked up the two parts of the body and wrapped them in plastic,
the head and the corpse.
I put them in a large freezer we kept for meat.
When Joyce got home that night she saw the mess,
a brownish liquid on the walls and floor.
I had no choice but to tell her what happened.
It might sound weird,
but by this point we were so accustomed to the ranch that nothing really struck us as weird anymore,
so when I told Joyce I killed a gray with the samurai sword it took her about five seconds to digest and then she just nodded.
Her only question was what did I do with the corpse.



##The Alien Cadaver

The dead gray alien was in my freezer for some time.
I literally didn't know what to do with it.
Things continued on the ranch.
Nothing really abated.
The one thing that did happen was Joyce and I started getting consciously abducted by the grays.
Abduction is something you become aware of after it has happened.
Gray aliens have the ability to take all memory of something out of us.
Most people who come to an understanding that they've been abducted do so through hypnotherapy.
It remains in another part of the consciousness,
separated from our waking mind.
There are countless people on the planet who have been abducted and do not know it.
I would say that the abduction phenomenon is widespread and spans most of the world,
but it is heavily concentrated in the United States,
and it is true that Arizona is a hotspot for UFO abductions,
New Mexico as well.


I really didn't understand what I had done.
I had killed what is ostensibly a sentient being.
Given that the government does not officially recognize the existence of extraterrestrials,
I seriously doubted that there were any legal consequences.
There are no homicide investigations for dead extraterrestrials.
Nonetheless,
I had done something,
something big,
something uncommon.
You have to understand that I was acting from the position of a man who was experiencing a home invasion.
I saw my actions as no different than a man who shoots an intruder entering their house in the middle of the night.


With a dead gray alien in my freezer,
I was faced with the uncomfortable responsibility of going public.
Sure,
a lot of people knew about my ranch.
The Mormon Bishop knew.
Many of the Buckeye locals knew.
It was mainly a regional story back then,
not so much an extraterrestrial story,
more about a bizarre house with a bizarre history and a number of deaths associated with it,
none of them alien.
This was something else entirely.


I had reached out to the Department of Agriculture and to the Sheriff's Office and two other agencies regarding the death of my dog.
It was nothing they hadn't heard before.
Whatever the government knew about what was going on in Arizona.
they weren't sharing it with the public.
This has been a theme of extraterrestrial phenomenon in the United States since its inception.
This is why the UFO world remains a counterculture relegated to the world of conspiracy and superstition,
the tinfoil-hat world.

Now let me be clear here:
going public in the UFO world doesn't mean that you're going to end up on the front of every newspaper just because you have a dead alien body.
The world of UFOs is one of the most guarded and secret sub-cultures in the world,
with the United States Government and military being one of the most active players in the widespread dissemination of disinformation related to UFOs.
It's no coincidence that many of the big players in the UFO world are retired military and intelligence people.
They were under strict orders while in service not to disclose information.
Many of them found their code of silence,
the see no UFO,
hear no UFO philosophy,
a hard pill to swallow.
Upon retirement many of these men and women become vocal proselytizers of the UFO phenomenon,
believing that people have a right and a need to know that we're not alone on this planet,
in this solar system.
this galaxy,
this universe,
and other universes.
Everybody has their own motivation for going public.
For some people,
it's just the idea of information this fantastical being restricted from the general public.
Other people,
coming from a deeper place in the military or intelligence community,
may have a protection or security *crisis of conscience* based on what they know.
The only thing I can tell you for sure is disclosure is not disclosure,
the government is misinforming you,
and there is an active effort to thwart real disclosure.
You could rent a truck with loudspeakers and drive all through Washington DC blaring your message and you still wouldn't end up on the front pages of newspapers and 
magazines around the world.
The UFO world has been deliberately occulted by the mainstream media and by the powers that be in our world.
There are any number of reasons for this,
the one that strikes me as the most likely is that the government has had direct contact with UFOs,
made arrangements and treaties with them,
and those arrangements and treaties did not work out the way the government wanted,
and now the government is left holding a bag of very dirty secrets that they don't want to own.



I went back to Captain Robert Collins,
who I had not spoken with very much for quite some time.
Maybe I was a little put off by the Men in Black,
truth be told.
I did lay off posting on Gersten's website as they had instructed.
It's funny because at a mental level I had a defiant attitude,
but in actuality I did what they told me to do.
It might have been some kind of Jedi mind trick they played on me.
I hadn't even thought it all through until the dead alien in the freezer.



The UFO world is populated with experiences.
Very few people can aggregate those experiences into any kind of meaningful narrative,
though.
Add to this the high number of people in the UFO world who are former intelligence or military or military intelligence and the narrative gets even more muddled.
Whenever you have a lot of government and quasi-government people associated with anything what is going on is a controlled narrative.
Very often the narrative is controlled not to deny the experience,
because the experience cannot be denied,
but to prevent any kind of meaningful aggregation of the experiences.
Collins was a master of his craft.


He told wild stories about discs that had been found and reverse engineering going on and secret laboratories.
It was like dim light going through a dirty diamond.
There was no clear picture.
I had the smoking gun.
Collins was more interested in what I told him than anything he had ever heard before.
I had an alien in my freezer,
killed with a samurai sword.
He had a very clear plan of action.
We needed to get tissue samples to a doctor he knew,
a Doctor Levengood in Michigan.
Levengood was a biophysicist and crop circle researcher who was fascinated by the UFO world.
We were going to run tests on the tissues and determine whether the DNA was part of the genomes on planet earth.[^2]


[^2]: MacDonald Note: The first time I tried to write this book, in 2012-2013, right around the time I was getting prepped to interview Dr. Levengood, he died. No record of his work with John Edmonds's samples exists except the material provided by Edmonds himself.

Levengood's obituary [^3] reads, in part, as follows:

[^3]: http://www.openminds.tv/biophysicist-and-crop-circle-researcher-w-c-levengood-passes-1971/24370

>Lefty” Levengood, a pioneering biophysicist and long-time resident of Grass Lake, Michigan (and the “L” in the original “BLT Research Team”), has died at the age of 88. Educated at the University of Toledo (B.S. in Physics and Mathematics, 1957), Ball State University (M.A. in Bioscience, 1961) and the University of Michigan (M.S. in Biophysics, 1970), Levengood worked as a research physicist at the now-defunct Institute of Science & Technology and the Dept. of Natural Resources at the University of Michigan from 1961 through 1970, after which he was employed as the Director of Biophysical Research and as a consulting scientist for various private-sector companies.


>Because of his wide-ranging scientific curiosity he maintained a well-equipped laboratory at his home in Grass Lake, where he pursued a variety of interests and obtained multiple patents, several relating to seed germination and vigor and the development of new plant varieties through genetic transduction. He also authored more than 50 peer-reviewed papers published in professional scientific journals, including several in the preeminent journals Nature and Science, as well as in a diverse selection of other professional publications, ranging from The American J. of Physics and the J. of Applied Physics to The J. of Experimental Botany, The J. of Chemical Physics, The J. of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, Bioelectochemistry and Bioenergetics, The J. of Geophysical Research, to The J. of Insect Physiology and many others.

>In December of 1990, after his wife Glenna had seen a TV crop circle show (which he then subsequently also watched), Levengood contacted Pat Delgado (one of the original British investigators of the phenomenon) and they arranged for Delgado to begin shipping plant samples and controls to “Lefty’s” Michigan laboratory. Almost immediately Levengood began to find multiple anomalies in the plant samples from within the crop circles as compared to the control plants taken at various distances outside the formations (but in the same fields). In these early trial stages of his crop circle research some approaches were non-productive, while others began to build a consistent data set of abnormal changes characteristic of the crop circle plants.

He maintained a thirteen year interest in the crop circle phenomenon, 
electromagnetic energy, 
and UFOs. 
Collins and I contacted Levengood.
He was excited by what we told him.
He made a laundry list of tissue and *part* requests.
I did exactly as instructed and sent everything by insured FedEx.
