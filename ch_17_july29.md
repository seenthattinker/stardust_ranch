July 31 2011
====================

Cynthia Crawford had told Brandy that I was being attacked by a band of renegade gray aliens.
I had no idea that renegades existed in extraterrestrial cultures.
You live and you learn.
Brandy had been abducted since the age of four,
and these experiences had formed the adult who could do what she did,
which was confront negative extraterrestrials.
I suppose you could compare it to an exorcism,
but,
instead of demonic forces,
extraterrestrials had to be removed.
She did not come from a military family,
which I found both surprising and refreshing.
Many of the abductions are associated with families that are in the military.
This may suggest that the family member in the military has entered into an agreement and given consent to allow their children to be abducted and trained by alien races.
This was certainly the case with Cynthia Crawford with a father in the CIA progenitor the OSS.
It's another chapter in the undocumented and largely unknown world of government involvement in the UFO culture which is just now beginning to enter the human dialogue.
According to Brandy,
she was told to go out to the ranch with two warriors from Sirius,
and that would be the constellation Sirius.
She referred to them only as Jay and Jay,
kind of like the two brothers from the old Bob Newhart show,
those these Jays were not brothers.
It was at this point that I learned that Sirius was a warrior culture that was aligned with a *Galactic Council* and used for enforcement of the laws that govern said council.
As Brandy put it,
*if you need something done,
get some Sirians.*


According to what Brandy told me,
as they were driving up the road toward my ranch gate,
somebody in the car noticed four clouds and pointed them out to the other passengers.
They were very odd formations.
Brandy looked up and told them they were not clouds;
they were ships.
She explained that very often alien ships mask themselves as clouds,
but if you have the eyes to see,
the formations will let you know they are ships.
And sure enough,
the moment she recognized them as ships,
they uncloaked.
Everybody in the car saw them for a moment before they cloaked back again.
This was the backup.
Brandy was told telepathically that five ships had been sent to support her mission at the ranch.



A short distance before they arrived at the ranch,
Brandy felt a presence off to her right and she told the Jays there was an underground hub for the grays there.
It was putting out a vibration she could feel.
By hub,
she meant a place where the gray aliens congregated.
When they arrived at the ranch and got out of the vehicle,
Brandy felt a magnificent energy.
This is the duality of Stardust Ranch.
Even with all the negativity,
the animal slaughters,
the levitating wife,
the abductions,
and the sorted litany of dirty deeds,
my ranch could imbue you with a strangely reverent feeling,
even holy,
I dare say,
despite the grays and their negativity.
Brandy also felt the presence of those who were,
as she describes it,
*not of the light*,
a one size fits all term for entities and beings of a dark,
self-serving nature.
Brandy told me in our initial conversation she believed the reason the gray aliens had settled at my ranch was because they were attracted to the higher vibration energy.
I found that a bit odd.
I really didn't understand it at the time.
Why would negative beings be attracted to a positive energy?
I would later in my sojourn at the ranch realize that the world was not so black and white as I had conceived it to be.
There were far more nuances.
Positive energy is constructive.
Everything needs positive energy.
It is the essence of the creator,
and all things,
good and bad,
need it. 
It was an important realization for me.
It helped me find forgiveness and understanding on the ranch,
and that was the beginning of a great healing.
I had been so dualistic in my thinking and actions.
I had been throwing gasoline on the fire,
killing the gray aliens when I could,
hating them,
feeding them.
It was an energy seepage that was like a nectar to them,
like honey for a bear.

##The Suicide


I went out of the house and greeted Brandy and her companions.
Joyce was supposed to be there but she was late.
I told them she would be joining us later.
I noticed they had brought swords,
and here I mean medieval broadswords,
real swords,
so real in fact I wondered where someone would get what appeared to be an authentic sword from the Middle Ages.
I didn't ask any questions,
though the oddity of a real samurai sword falling off a truck in front of me on the road some years previous did enter my mind,
but you'd be amazed how blank your mind goes to asking questions when people show up at your ranch to confront a band of rogue gray aliens.
Almost everything seems normal the moment you accept that original premise.


I escorted Brandy and the two men she had brought with her into my ranch.
Brandy immediately tuned into a very negative energy.
She began to cleanse the house.
Upon entering the room where the suicide had taken place,
she immediately sensed the young man.
She told me the young man had shot himself and his spirit had been in the house since that time.
I confirmed to her that indeed a seventeen-year-old boy had put a shotgun in his mouth on his graduation day from high school.
Brandy and the two Jays prayed over him and sent him as much love as they could.
The wall I was standing beside began to heat up.
It got so hot I thought it was going to burst into flames.
Brandy told the boy it's time to move on as she and her Sirian companions prayed intensely,
and she heard a voice say,
*that's the most love I have ever felt*.
Then he left.
I told Brandy that I had intermittently felt the human spirit in the house from time to time,
but it was so difficult to distinguish from the other stuff going on.
I remember when I was doing renovations on the house,
I tore up the floor in the room the boy had killed himself,
and there was still blood on the concrete.


I should take a moment here to explain what Brandy told me.
Very often when a human being dies in a tragedy they have difficulty moving on because of the weight they carry on the other side.
Here we are talking about the astral body.
Some people might refer to it as the light body or the translucent body.
It's the form we all have right after the physical body.
It's associated with our feelings and sensory data.
Just as the physical body can get overloaded with food and unable to move well,
the astral body can get saturated with negative emotions and stuck in a position after death,
and again,
this is most common in violent and sudden deaths where there is very strong emotion.
The person has tremendous difficulty changing their vibration because to do so they have to completely digest what they did,
accept it,
forgive themselves,
and begin to allow love back into them.
That Mexican boy had been in my house for fifteen years.
When I saw Brandy do what she did
&mdash;
release the boy
&mdash;
I felt a little impotent as a spiritual being.
This poor kid had been serving a penance in my house for a decade and a half and there was nothing I could do for him.
Joyce and I had felt him on occasion, 
but the subtle differences between fourth dimensional presences was not something we had learned to discern early on.
For a long time at the ranch it was all just under the umbrella of *weird*.
It stunned me when Brandy came into my home and immediately dealt with the boy.
She knew the generalities without any assistance from me
&mdash;
a young boy had died violently in the room.
I told her about the family that farmed cattle,
the high school graduation,
and the shotgun.
Even now,
as I tell this story within my story,
I remember that I forgot to ask why he killed himself.
I guess it doesn't matter.
I suspect that the aliens influenced him.
They can induce depression,
anger,
and suicide ultimately.
In the end,
the battle was territorial.
The aliens didn't want any humans living at the ranch.
I had to learn that my moods were being influenced,
that the anger and rage I would feel,
the absolute bewilderment and frustration when they would disappear car keys and cell phones,
was them trying to push me off the ranch any way they could,
which is probably what the young man succumbed to at the ranch.
It never ceases to amaze me how human consciousness in the subtle forms,
like the astral body,
can affect physical reality.
It makes you pause and think of all the deaths,
divorces,
and incarcerations that might have been influenced by the other side,
and it makes me think of we human beings,
our petty egos,
our pride,
and our insensitivity.
These extraordinary teachers come to the planet
&mdash;
Abraham,
Jesus,
Muhammad,
Milarepa,
and Kabir,
to name a few
&mdash;
and our human tendencies and vulgarities create robed professionals who argue doctrine like insurance underwriters disputing a claim.
It's sickening how ill the human race is,
how spiritually ill we are,
and how many people have been forced onto pharmaceuticals and told they are mentally ill when in fact they are not hearing voices or seeing things;
they are being attacked  from the fourth dimension.
The ranch became a spiritual crucible for me,
a realignment of my life priorities,
and a consecration to the divine.
When the young man left my home,
he did so because he allowed love and forgiveness into him.
While he was there,
I could feel him from time to time.
It wasn't a malicious presence.
He didn't want to hurt Joyce or I.
He just wanted to be left alone.
It's another reminder that it is very important that we love ourselves and work through all of our emotional conditions in life.
How many people are locked in a stasis in the afterlife?
How we die is extremely important.


One the most famous near-death experiences in the twentieth century was that of a fellow by the name of Dannion Brinkley.
He was struck by lightning a number of times in his life.
I think he died three times.
He wrote several books and described exactly what Brandy was telling me in my home after she cleared the young Mexican boy out.
How important it is for us to live our lives truly and correctly and to stay in a good emotional place and,  most importantly,
to allow love into us.
As we get into the subtler bodies that exist inside of us and we occupy after death,
it's important that we understand that love determines where we go and where we fit in after the body fails.
Love is a kind of fuel on the other side that allows us to move.
It gives us a lightness so that we can rise up to better worlds.
The heaviness of a life laden with guilt and negative emotions fixes us to certain positions very close to the physical world,
often very close to the area that the last act of hate or aggression took place.
It could be one explanation for purgatory,
and it certainly explains ghosts,
or at least part of it.
One of the very many beautiful things that Brinkley did with his life was set up a hospice system in the United States,
a place where people could go and die if they did not have family,
a place where they could be loved before they passed the world,
a place where they could let love into them.
Very beautiful indeed.


##The Portals



After that rather dramatic incident,
which was just the beginning of Brandy's visit
&mdash;
we hadn't even begun to deal with the portals or the extraterrestrials yet
&mdash;
I took her to the room where I believed the portal was.
She did some work in clearing the area.
When I say work,
I mean she would close her eyes and a very intense look would come over her face,
and she would sort of quietly whisper in prayer.
After some long minutes of this,
she asked us all to sit around the coffee table,
so we all went over to the coffee table,
me,
Brandy,
and the two men that she called the two Jays.
She told me that she had been instructed to *hold a space*.
This was to allow the opening of a portal that she herself created.
She explained that it provided a hologram for benevolent beings to come through,
and Brandy told me that they wanted to speak to me.
They had specific messages for me.


What I saw happen next was quite astounding.
A sort of globe appeared above the table.
It was like a hologram from a movie,
or a computer generated interface,
otherworldly.
Then three beings came through.
They were wearing breastplates and armor,
and they had swords.
I know what this sounds like,
however,
I have an obligation to report the truth,
and I am telling you the truth.
I long ago gave up any feeling about being embarrassed by speaking in public about what I have experienced.
People need to know there's more to this world and our existence than what our senses and mind show us,
much more.
I can only tell you what I saw and what happened,
no more,
no less.
I have no idea why higher order beings from another dimension,
another world,
would be brandishing weapons and armor more typical of seven hundred years ago in our human history,
but they were.
Brandy herself does not remember the incident too well.
When she opens a portal like that and becomes *the space holder*,
she's in another place and not really present to observe what's going on through the space that she's keeping open.
I had to tell her what happened later on.




##The Ships


We went outside when Brandy stopped *holding the space*.
She went and spoke to the horses.
She has the ability to communicate with animals.
They told her their version of what had been happening on the ranch,
the mutilations,
the negative beings.
Brandy explained to me that they could kill my animals but I was off limits,
as was Joyce.
She explained a cosmology in which there were not so much rules but consequences.
If they killed human beings they invoked a countermeasure from beings capable of dealing with them more effectively than a human being,
so,
in fear of that confrontation,
they only tried to influence us,
frighten us,
torment us,
keep us so psychologically imbalanced that we decided to leave the ranch,
which was theirs as they saw it,
not the actual house or the stables or the kennels,
but the portals on the property,
which they perceived as theirs because they knew how to use them.
It's not like Joyce and I were putting on our dancing shoes and time traveling through interdimensional doors on weekends.
In a weird way I understood the position of the grays.
Taking the land  from us was like taking a diamond from a monkey in the jungle
&mdash;
what use did the monkey have for the diamond
&mdash;
it's just that in this case the diamond was our home,
even though we didn't see any value in it other than a home.


Brandy walked the property line,
all the while doing what she called *energy work*,
which was raising the vibration to make it more difficult for non love-centered entities to come onto my property.
Then we went to the front of the property,
close to where the metal gate is located.
It was there that Brandy felt a very strong presence of the  grays.
Those were the ones,
as she put it,
that she decided to *negotiate* with.
She did some blessings,
and then she and her two Jays turned around to face the south.
I turned to look as well.
The sky was a beautiful shade of orange,
almost like a tangerine color,
and then I saw a plethora of ships uncloak.
It was astounding.
I could not believe the size of them.
One of them must have been the size of two or three city blocks.
We turned and faced the east and that's when the mothership came into view.
I'm not even going to try and describe how big it was.
It was like a city floating in the sky.
Brandy began to speak.
It wasn't English.
I don't know what language she was speaking.
It sounded like Klingon from the Star Trek television show,
low and guttural, 
like Mongolian throat singing without the melody.
She told me later that she was still in a trance state.
She spoke directly to the grays,
ordered them to leave the property,
notified them that if they surrendered they'd be treated well.
They would be escorted to what Brandy defined as the equivalent of a *reform school*.
The whole thing played out like an interdimensional High Noon with her as the sheriff,
but she wasn't outgunned. 
The ships that had uncloaked were to let the grays know what they were facing
&mdash;
a show of force.
The grays at Stardust Ranch were defined time and time again as a *rogue* group.
This is an important point and it needs some explanation.
Very often in the world of exopolitics we perceive alien races as completely uniform and homogeneous.
While it is true they do have more of a hive mind than humans,
extraterrestrial races are as diverse as the human race.
We have everything from leaders of criminal organizations to holy people in the human race.
The same dichotomy exists in the other races.
I was told that the rogue group of grays on my property was living there because they were attracted by the high vibration of the portal.
There were three ships with about twenty grays on each ship for a total of sixty rogue grays,
apparently very attached to the portals on my property,
and especially the one portal that had the time dimension,
either past or future.
I had already killed a number of them,
maybe close to a dozen,
by the time that Brandy came out with her to warriors from Sirius.

##Lightning Strikes

The low guttural language that Brandy was speaking went on for quite some time,
at least ten minutes.
I had no idea what was being said or who was listening to it.
I could tell by her disposition and the disposition of the two Sirian warriors that she had brought,
the two Jays,
that things were not going as well as they wanted them to go as far as a peaceful negotiation.
I noticed that clouds had begun to form directly above us,
dark,
charcoal colored clouds that seemed full of water.
It was too sudden for it to be a natural phenomenon.
Something was bringing the clouds together right above us at the ranch.
Amidst this unknown language of the three parties on the ground,
Brandy and the two Jays,
they formed a circle at one point and all of them raised their swords.
They weren't just decorations.
They weren't role playing Dungeons and Dragons.
I later learned that swords are an archetypal weapon in the cosmos,
representing truth and honor and the willingness to fight from the heart,
as opposed to camping out a thousand yards away and shooting someone with a sniper rifle,
I suppose. 
Swords meant you fought for the truth and you fought with honor.
It makes me rethink the entire notion that the archangels are allegorical beings as opposed to literal.


At this point in the negotiations all three of them raised their swords and touched the tips,
and,
at that exact moment,
a bolt of purple lightning came down and struck the ground several feet away from the trio.
It was a loud,
booming sound,
disorienting and utterly baffling.
My mind went blank for about ten seconds,
the way I imagine a person blanks close to an explosion.
I felt like I was beside myself,
looking on the whole surreal affair as a serene and detached observer,
then I snapped back into my body,
and my mind reminded me of what had just happened.
They were all as directly affected as me.

Brandy was profoundly disoriented.
There was a circular black scorch mark on the ground,
maybe three feet in diameter.
The two Sirian warriors left with Brandy almost immediately,
with Brandy looking at me and saying,
I don't think they'll bother you anymore,
as she strode away.
She seemed a little *off* to me. 
It was not until a few days later that I was able to speak to Brandy on the telephone.
She had no knowledge of being struck by lightning,
but something had happened.
The energy from the purple bolt had traveled through the ground and through the cork soles of her footwear,
and it had affected her somehow.
She was having memory problems.
She told me that she had been visited by the Men in Black[^10].

[^10]: MacDonald Note. I asked Brandy Howe when I interviewed her what the Men in Black are. She told me she could not tell me, that this information was not timed to come out yet.

She was told in no uncertain terms that she was not to speak publicly about what happened at Stardust Ranch on July 31th, 2011.
With God as my witness and all that I hold sacred in life,
as crazy as these details sound,
as outlandish as they sound,
as storybook as they sound,
they happened just as I am telling you they happened.
In later weeks I heard from Brandy that one of the Sirians had gone crazy.
He started to hear voices and see things and had to be institutionalized.
The other Sirian took his family and went underground,
completely off the grid.

We stirred something up at the ranch.
I later heard through a network of common acquaintances that it took three or four years for Brandy to get normal after the lightning strike.
Vast portions of her memory were taken from her.
The presence of the rogue grays abated a little,
but it never went away.
The abductions stopped for the most part.
It seemed as though some kind of a truce had been struck.
But the idea of the grays being removed and turned over to a reform institution in the galactic council  did not happen.
To this day I really don't know what happened on that fateful day,
July 31th,
2011.
The only thing I know for sure is that my life changed dramatically.
Once I met benign extraterrestrials through Brandy,
they became a part of my life.
I will get into that in a subsequent chapter.



##The Sirians


The beings from Sirius are known throughout the Milky Way Galaxy and beyond as warriors and protectors.
They are relied upon to effect forced change on beings who are creating profound disturbances like the grays at my ranch.
It's important to note here how Brandy defined the two warriors from Sirius.
They were human beings.
They were born on this world.
They grew up on this world.
When Brandy says they were two warriors from Sirius,
she is saying that they were walk-ins.
A walk-in occurs when a human life commences and the soul that occupies the body has made a contract to vacate the body at a certain point and switch places with another being who then walks in and takes over the body and lives the life.
This was a very important point for me to get my head around.
The questions that brought me to resolution were the result of Brandy telling me the consequences for the two warriors from Sirius that came to my ranch.
One of them went briefly insane.
The other one had a family and had to go into hiding for a while.
The threats from the powers-that-be in the dark side of the exopolitics world,
the side of the exopolitics world that nobody speaks about,
were so great that he was in fear for his life and the life of his family.



So let's get a proper definition of what a walk-in is.
It would not be unfair to say that walk-in is a new age term.
I don't like to use the phrase new age.
It bothers me tremendously for some reason.
It seems to me that it has become as ridiculous and contradictory as the traditional religions.
However,
I don't see any way of avoiding this.
The term definitely comes into vogue through the new age community in the latter part of the twentieth century.


In typical form,
the military-industrial-entertainment complex
&mdash;
read Hollywood here
&mdash;
addresses the idea of a walk-in,
and specifically an extraterrestrial walk-in,
in the film adaptation of the novel *K-Pax*.
The novel was written by a gentleman named Gene Brewer and published in 1995.
The film followed in 2001 and starred Kevin Spacey.
In the film Spacey is a man under the supervision of a psychiatrist played by Jeff Bridges.
It's actually a remake of an earlier film called *The Man facing Southeast*,
made in 1986 in Argentina.
It is entirely possible that Gene Brewer ripped off the premise for the novel from the original Argentine film.
But I certainly don't want to digress here into a diatribe on plagiarism.
Let's stick with the Kevin Spacey film,
K-Pax.


Spacey's character is named Prot.
He presents a beguiling conundrum for his psychiatrist,
Jeff Bridges.
The film allows the viewer to explore the idea of a walk-in.
Prot is an extraterrestrial walk-in who stepped into a body at a moment of suicide.
He revived the body and continued existence with the being inside completely changed.
If all of this sounds a little bit fantastical,
even the Tibetan Buddhists talk about walk-ins.
It has been a part of their culture for centuries.


The easiest way to come to a comprehension of what a walk-in is is to watch the film K-Pax.
For the purposes of this narrative,
I have done all I can to present the definition,
and we must accept that the two warriors from Sirius were walk-ins,
part of a contract made with the human souls before they incarnated.
I am in no position to disagree with Brandy,
nor am I inclined to contest the narrative.
It not only seems plausible to me,
but likely.


##Brandy the White

It was just when I started working on this book in 2019 that I got more detail on Brandy.
She and I had lost touch.
We tried to stay in touch for the first year after she came out here,
I live very close in Phoenix,
but something always seemed to get in our way,
as though we were not supposed to be communicating.
I heard through my co-writer,
Bruce McDonald,
who did all the interviews for the novel,
that Brandy regarded the event at my Ranch as an initiation.


In spiritual and occult paths an initiation is the sudden endowment of a new realization.
Initiations are usually disorienting and difficult.
Consciousness does not come easy for the human race.
Most of the people I know who have developed any kind of clairvoyant ability have done so through  intense trial,
very often a long and protracted struggle with a mortal disease,
or a long,
intense psychological turmoil,
like being abducted on a regular basis by gray aliens.
It's a combination of the stress of remembering the abductions when the memories do come back and the consistent transportation to the fourth dimension where the abductions take place.


All human beings are interdimensional.
And many of the dreams people have at night are on another dimension,
usually the astral plane.
But abduction takes more of the waking mind into the fourth dimension.
People who meditate regularly for years often develop perceptual abilities well beyond the norm.


The engagement by Brandy with the gray aliens was another kind of initiation.
The purple lightning struck the ground close enough to her that she was deeply affected by the energy.
I later found out that it traveled underground and went right into her body.
She developed new ways of perceiving reality and new understandings.
Whatever happened at my ranch on July 31st,
2011,
like Gandalf in the movie *Lord of the Rings:
The  Fellowship of the Ring*,
Brandy came out at a certain level of consciousness and left at a new level of consciousness that would take her some time,
several years,
to rebalance into herself.
If you remember the movie,
the Challenge that Gandalf the Gray faced was the Balrog,
the ancient fiery demon in the underground,
both Gandalf and the Balrog fall into a Chasm and engage in mortal combat.
Gandalf prevails and returns from the chasm as Gandalf the White.
He has new powers and a new mission.
Brandy documents her own experience on my Ranch on her website.


###Dr. Brandy's Personal Lightning Testimonial

On July 31st, 2011,
I was indirectly struck by lightning.
The lightning entered through the ground behind me and surfaced up through my heels and went out through the top of my head.



Five days after the strike I was given a message from the Above which said.

You need to do Lightning Therapy.

I asked What is Lightning Therapy?

As I always get answers;
I was baffled as none came.
I ended my meditation with the statement.
I guess that you will just tell me,
when I need to know.


The very next day,
I walked into a metaphysical store that I worked at three days per week and there were twenty Fulgurites sitting on the back table.
I was in awe,
so to speak,
as I looked at these specimens which said on their box:
Lightning In A Box!

That is when I started my research on Fulgurites and was awakened to the
mystical,
magical and practical powers if you will,
that these awesome tubes hold.


If anyone of you has the Crystal Bible Two,
Fulgurite is listed in there with it's awesome properties.
The Crystal Bibles (Judy Hall) are available on Amazon.com and many metaphysical stores as well.


Approximately,
two weeks after the lightning strike,
I started experiencing many physical issues.
I developed a hematoma and subsequently started bleeding through my nose,
mouth and then vaginally.
(As I had a hysterectomy some 30 years ago,
that event stirred up my curiosity,
if you will,
as to why this was all happening.)  
In my research,
I found that it was not uncommon for bleeding to occur due to the lightning damaging blood vessels,
which could later break,
from the impact of the strike.


I then started to experience memory loss,
dizziness,
loss of vision,
confusion and what can best be described as haziness as I moved through my daily routines.


As it came to a head one day,
my employer refused to let me return to work until I went to the hospital emergency.
I reluctantly obliged as I was feeling that I was ready to check out if you will.
I did not have insurance and I knew that this was going to be a very expensive trip.


My trip to the hospital was also very unpleasant as I described to the doctors why I was there;
they looked at me like I was crazy and accused me of being on drugs.
For the record,
I have never taken drugs in this lifetime!  
They were very rude and condescending,
to say the least.


I was happy that I had brought my camera and provided them with some proof of the occurrence.
They still did not get it as they kept saying:

If you got hit by lightning,
you would be dead!  Well,
not everyone that gets hit by lightning dies,
if you will,
but everyone,
I can guarantee you,
has a life changing experience!

It was shortly thereafter that The Thirteen Universal Beings of Light started downloading me with information on using the Fulgurites with other healing crystals and guided me on how to use them for my healing and subsequently,
guided me to help others to do the same.


Through Divine Guidance,
I have now encompassed the Fulgurites,
along with several other Extremely powerful and scarce Crystals to promote Healing,
Relieving Blockages,
Brain Rewiring and Chakra Activation.[^11]
