Desert Mysteries
===================




I was driving out in the desert with two of the dogs,
and I had an intuitive nudge to stop the Jeep and turn off the engine.
I did.
It was a little after noon,
the hottest part of the day,
and some days it could get up to one hundred and twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit.
I grabbed a water canteen and left the Jeep with the dogs to go on a little walkabout.
I didn't usually do this.
Sometimes I stopped if I saw something,
a metal object or something that I might want to get out of the vehicle and pick up,
but,
for the most part,
I stayed in the Jeep with the air conditioning on.
The conditions outside the Jeep in the middle of the day were just too rigorous for a human being to survive very long.
There was a small hill about a hundred meters off in the distance and my intuition was guiding me towards it.
With the two Rottweilers at my side I felt fairly secure.
I also had a 357 handgun strapped to my hip.
The water canteen was over my shoulder,
and I had a good pair of walking boots and a straw cowboy hat to keep the sun off my head.


When I crested the small hill,
I looked down upon a little valley in which there was a circle where all of the growth was missing.
Now this was a very odd thing.
There was no rational explanation for all the missing vegetation.
The desert is by no means a rainforest,
but what does grow there grows consistently,
across every square yard of the desert.
In this particular spot,
a circumference of about two-hundred yards,
what struck me was it had the same kind of look as a crop circle,
where everything was just missing instead of the usual crop circle design.
The desert floor was bald and naked of any vegetation or scrub.
If that was not weird enough,
in the center of this barren circle was a second circle,
a circle of shoes.
I walked down the small hill and examined the shoes.
There were hundreds of pairs.
The circumference of the circle of shoes was about a hundred yards.
organized into men's shoes,
women's shoes,
children's shoes,
and a fourth group which I would describe as miscellaneous.
They were all in pairs and the toes were all pointing in towards the center of the circle.

I wanted to get the camcorder in the truck.
It was always in the glove compartment.
The oddity of Stardust Ranch and Rainbow Valley had made me an amateur videographer.
I wanted to get the circle of shoes on video.
I walked back to the truck,
sipping some water as I did,
no rush to my movement,
the dogs lazily walking beside me,
the sun as intense on them as it was on me.
I opened the passenger door and retrieved the camcorder.
I went back to where the circle of shoes was.
I trained the camera lens on the circle of shoes and hit record.




As I stood there,
trying to figure out why there would be a circle of shoes in the middle of the desert,
and why there would be an area of no vegetation in a perfect circle,
I started to feel what I can only describe as an electrical charge.
The hair on my arms stood up.
Something had changed in the atmosphere.
The dogs were both lying down beside me,
their stomachs on the ground,
their chins buried in their front legs,
with a submissive position,
a docile position.
I turned around.
What was behind me was beyond anything I'd ever fathomed before.
It was a giant black triangle,
a ship.
It was it at least as big as a football field,
maybe bigger.
I could see lights underneath it.
It was just hovering off the ground,
about a hundred feet away from me,
and about a hundred feet off the ground.
It seemed to be just stopped there,
looking at me.
That's the last thing I remember.
I went unconscious.


The camcorder kept going.
The digital video shot indicated that I had been unconscious for an hour,
under the blazing sun of the desert.
The dogs were beside me.
When I started to wake up they immediately licked my face.
Their saliva was a nice balm.
All three of us were extremely dehydrated.
My skin had been burned to a crisp.
I could feel the tightness of my face,
and I could feel the skin almost wanting to jump off my arms.
My legs and torso were okay because I had pants and a shirt on,
albeit short-sleeved.
I was groggy but managed to stand up.
My balance came back to me after about ten seconds.
I stopped the camcorder.
It wasn't quite an hour I had been unconscious;
it was fifty-five minutes.
I don't know what knocked me unconscious.
I stumbled back to the truck,
rehydrated myself and the dogs,
apologized profusely to the dogs for what I had put them through,
closed all the windows in the truck,
turned on the engine,
and put on the air-conditioning.
The camcorder had been on for fifty-five minutes but nothing had been recorded.



After about ten minutes of cooling down,
I put the truck in drive and headed back home.
When Joyce got home I was asleep on the sofa.
My face was as red as a tomato,
as were my arms.
She came over and woke me up.
I told her the story.
She made another petition for us to leave the ranch and Rainbow Valley.
I shook my head like the obstinate son-of-a-bitch that I am.


No,
I said.
I'm not going anywhere.


The more strange the ranch and the surrounding area became,
the more entrenched I became in my position.





My fascination with the desert did not abate.
I don't know if I'm just straight-up stupid or the fear gene is something I don't have,
like some kind of emotional leprosy.
I kept going into the desert,
exploring the area around my ranch. 
I had one long disappearance,
eighteen hours I could not account for,
and I woke up far from home and naked.
I had to walk barefoot through the desert under the blaring sun for hours to find my way home.
This still didn't deter me from going into the desert.


##Native History


Arizona is an ancient part of the United States.
It is home to the Hopi Indians and the Navajo Indians,
among others.
I see artifacts of these cultures all through the desert in stone carvings.
Adobe structures are still standing a thousand years later,
and there are markings on the walls of caves and mountainsides.
Very close to my ranch are the Estrella Mountains.
They were named so by the Jesuits in the eighteen hundreds.
By some bizarre twist of fate,
estrella means star in Spanish,
so the Jesuits named them the star mountains.
Perhaps the Jesuits themselves experienced something celestial in that part of Arizona.


Archaeologists say that the history of the area goes back at least ten thousand years.
Nomads entered first,
hunters and gatherers,
then evidence shows they began to settle into agriculture and permanent living.
The earliest recorded people are called the Anasazi.
It's a Navajo word meaning enemy ancestors.
Somewhere around a thousand years ago they started building little Villages carved right into the mountainsides.
It's quite an architectural feat.
The archaeological record shows a desertion of the area around the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
Nobody really knows why the Anasazi left their homes.
Some postulate drought.
Another group called the Sinagua,
which means without water in Spanish,
developed alongside the Anasazi.
They may have deserted their homes as well around the same time.





By far the most prolific tribal peoples in the area are and were the Hopi.
They have a huge reservation in the north of Arizona,
one and a half million acres.
There are eleven main Hopi villages.
A group called the old are widely considered to be the oldest group of people living in the United States.
As of the year 2000,
the Hopi population was about seven thousand on the reserve.
The Hopi are most likely the direct descendants of the Anasazi.
They found their way into the new age world with some prophecies that were made some time ago and with an understanding of the stars that belies their technology,
things like the complete lack of telescopes and any concept of astronomy.
Nonetheless,
their knowledge of the star systems is quite unique.
Again,
One of the many mysteries dotting the areas in Arizona.
The Hopi are also known for a very deep and rich spiritual life.
Most of the rituals that they perform are meant to bring in crops.
They were trying to bring in corn and other things to sustain themselves in an area that gets an annual rainfall of about twelve inches.
The Hopi people believe in harmony with environment.




The Navajo people came much later and it's believed they came from as far away as Alaska and Canada.
Their migration took place sometime around a thousand years ago.
They mirrored the agricultural lifestyle of the Hopi.
The Navajo nation today encompasses about a quarter million people and just under three thousand square miles of reserve in the Four Corners area of Arizona.




Another native group is called the Yavapai.
This loosely translates to sun people.
They claim to be among the first people in the Sedona, Arizona region according to the Yavapai creation story.
They tell a story that is remarkably similar to Noah's Ark.
The lady of the pearl was put inside a log with a woodpecker and sent from Montezuma to prepare for a great flood,
and flood it did.
It rained for forty days and forty nights.
The water receded.
The log came to rest in Sedona,
and the woodpecker freed the beautiful young woman and led her on a journey to the Mingus Mountain with the white stone or pearl her people had given her for protection.




And then there were the Apache.
They were the descendants of people who came from the northeast sometime around the ninth century.
They frequently conflicted with the pueblo people in New Mexico and their name,
Apache,
might come from a Zuni word for enemy.
They garnered a fierce reputation as warriors in the Four Corners native population among the Spanish and the US forces that fought them during the long Indian Wars.
They were a little more nomadic than the other native populations in Arizona,
changing location quite often to pursue the animals they hunted for sustenance.
Horses weren't introduced until the Spanish came,
but the moment the Apache got a hold of them they became nearly mythic horse masters.



As I became more interested in the early history of Arizona,
and specifically the desert,
I would often wonder if any of these native peoples had the experiences I had.
I wondered if they had been abducted,
if they had met aliens,
if they had seen the lights in the sky?
My default answer is yes.
It certainly explains the Hopi cosmology,
but the Hopi cosmology means that there was a transfer of information,
which suggests a peaceful and amicable extraterrestrial race communicating with them.
I had experienced no such race yet.



Hopi spirituality defines a reality with multiple levels,
not dissimilar to string theory or the multiverse theory.
The Hopi believe that in the past worlds were destroyed and the Hopi were given a portal to go through to walk into the new world,
those who were chosen to survive.
In the modern twenty-first century it's difficult for rational westerners to engage native spirituality,
but that's only because we've sealed up the doorway of the imagination.



Of most interest to me when I did my native research on the State of Arizona were the stories about the mountains closest to me,
the Estrella Mountains.
These are not the most noted mountain ranges for paranormal activity in Arizona.
The most noted are the Superstitious Mountains.
The Estrella Mountains are known for portals.
The native lore speaks about portals opening up and what we might call gods coming through.
The stories of portals abound in Arizona.
It's hard to say what a portal is.
It's hard to say what creates a portal.
It's hard to say what sustains a portal.
All I can do is give you my understanding.
I'm not a shaman.
I'm not a scientist.
However,
I am a man who has lived with multiple portals on his land  and even inside his home.


A portal is a gateway between two or more worlds.
It can be a gateway between more than two worlds.
It is literally an opening up of our reality and an entrance way into another reality,
or,
conversely,
an entrance from that other reality into our reality.
Portals abound in our own storytelling.
*Alice in Wonderland* is a perfect example of a portal.
Even magicians who talk about mirrors are alluding to a way of creating a portal from a mirror.



The desert was a deeply fascinating place for me.
There are people who become absorbed in the lore of the Arizona desert and mountains and do workshops and hiking tours,
explaining the history and mystery surrounding various mountain ranges in Arizona.
The stories of high weirdness go back through all of the culture,
the native culture,
the Spanish,
the Jesuits,
and now me,
representing the latest people here on the land,
the Americans.
It's also interesting to note that every native culture in the world has a creation story in which the human race is seeded here.
They do not believe in evolution.
They believe we came here through something like the portals and that we were told to live here and develop ourselves here.


Deserts seem to be an integral part of human religious mythology.
The Arizona desert is full of paranormal activity.
I can attest to this after living here for two and a half decades.
I am also forced to contemplate other desert cultures,
like the people of the Middle East,
and specifically the Jews.
Many have made the connection between the Elohim and extraterrestrials,
noting that the Jews refer to the gods in the plural rather than one creator.
There is also the story of Jacob's fiery wheel.
The entire Torah may be read as a communication between a seated human race and another race from another dimension.
I don't allow the idea of extraterrestrials to interfere with my notion of a singular divine creator.
If the human form has been tinkered with at the level of DNA,
and we are in fact the creation of a superior species,
it still doesn't explain the spirit.
The other great desert culture that comes to mind is Egypt.
They were also a splendid and mystical culture.
The idea of portals abound in Egyptian culture.
Some attest that the pyramids themselves are portals.
In the world of science fiction and popular imagination,
the line is already drawn between the ancient Egyptians and extraterrestrials through the television series Stargate,
which commenced with a movie of the same name several decades ago.



The desert is a mysterious place.
The desert of Arizona is an especially mysterious place.
Many professional guides in Arizona will not take tourists into the Superstition Mountains after dark.
Some of the locals call them the murder mountains.
There is more death and craziness associated with the Superstition Mountains than almost any other place in Arizona.
It begins with the lost Dutchman's gold.
A German named Jacob Waltz told people that he found a large gold deposit in the Superstition Mountains,
and he told a woman named Julia Thomas where it was.
He stayed in a boarding house she ran in Phoenix.
She had taken care of him for a number of years and he felt beholden.
Ever since that rumor got out,
adventurers have been going to the Superstition Mountains to try and find their fortune,
but most of them just find their own deaths.
Couple this with multiple stories of encounters with unknown beasts and monsters at night,
some of them flying,
and most people just stay clear of the Superstition Mountains.
