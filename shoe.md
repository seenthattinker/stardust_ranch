Shoe Circle
================

On this particular day I was driving out in the desert with two of the dogs and I had an intuitive nudge to stop the Jeep and turn off the engine.
I did.
It was a little after noon,
the hottest part of the day,
and some days it could get up to 125 degrees Fahrenheit.
I grabbed a water canteen and left the Jeep with the dogs to go on a little walkabout.
I didn't usually do this.
Sometimes I stopped if I saw something,
a metal object or something that I might want to get out of the vehicle and pick up,
but,
for the most part,
I stayed in the Jeep with the air conditioning on,
the conditions outside of the Jeep in the middle of the day were just too rigorous for a human being to survive very long.
There was a small hill about a hundred meters off in the distance and my intuition was guiding me towards it.
With the two Rottweilers at my side and I felt fairly secure.
I also had a 357 handgun strapped to my hip.
The water canteen was over my shoulder and I had a good pair of walking boots on and a straw cowboy hat to keep the sun off my head.


When I crested the small hill I looked down upon a little valley in which there was a circle where all of the growth was missing.
Now this was a very odd thing.
There was no rational explanation for all the missing vegetation.
The desert is by no means a rainforest,
but what does grow there grows consistently,
across every square meter of the desert.
In this particular spot,
a circumference of about 200 meters,
what struck me was it had the same kind of effect as a crop circle,
where everything was just missing instead of the usual crop circle design.
The desert floor was bald and naked of any vegetation or scrub.
If that was not weird enough,
in the center of this barren circle was a second circle,
a circle of shoes.
I walked down the small hill and examined the shoes.
There were hundreds of pairs.
The circumference of the circle of shoes was about 100 meters.
organized into men's shoes,
women's shoes,
children's shoes,
and a fourth group which I would describe as miscellaneous.
They were all in pairs and the toes were all pointing in towards the center of the circle.
To this day it remains one of the strangest things I've ever seen in the desert.
