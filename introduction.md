Introduction
===============



I first met John Edmonds in 2012.
A mutual friend contacted me and asked me if I was interested in taking a look at a non-fiction book project.
He began to describe a UFO story taking place in Arizona.
I was never that interested in the whole world of exopolitics and extraterrestrials.
I knew it existed.
I didn't disbelieve it.
It just wasn't on my radar.
At that time,
the only book I had published to good reviews was a work of adult literary fiction in Canada.
I fancied myself a kind of Canadian Mark Twain,
a humorist and social observer.
I got very good reviews across Canada,
but my second novel didn't publish.
My living comes from technical writing in telecommunications and software.


After persistent badgering from my friend,
I decided to have a chat with John Edmonds.
The three of us got together on a conference call and John began to tell me what was going on at his ranch.
I wouldn't say that I was skeptical,
it's just that I really wasn't that interested.
I had read the Billy Meier work about the Pleiadian contact in Switzerland,
and I found all of that to be a bit dubious.
My fundamental question was what impact does this have on humanity?
Why should people be giving their time to this topic?
How is it any more important than us becoming a more cooperative and compassionate species so that we can survive on this planet?
After some persuasion,
I decided to give the book a try.
John Edmonds and I set up a working process.
We talked on Skype every day and I recorded the conversations and started to write.
After some months of this I quit.
I can't really describe what happened back then.
I became very negative towards the material.
It was the only manuscript I never finished.





Seven years went by and I never gave the book on Stardust Ranch a second thought.
My life changed dramatically.
I decided to leave North America and go into the wilds of Costa Rica.
I bought some land in the rainforest in the south of Costa Rica,
a place known as the Talamanca mountain range,
designated a United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) heritage site.
It might well be the most biodiverse thousand square kilometers in the world.



I brought my eighteen-year-old son over when he finished high school.
He wasn't sure what he wanted to do,
and he wanted to take some time off before he went to post-secondary education or into a trade.
So father and son made their way into the rainforest and began to build earthbag houses.
It was a wonderful project and we both learned Spanish and grew into the little *campesino* culture on the mountain,
which is a mix of Ticos and Cabecare natives.
Jaguars roam the mountains.
Howler monkeys scream through the jungle at dawn with a mating call that is the loudest sound in nature,
the decibel level exceeding a rock concert.
When walking off-road,
knee-high boots are mandatory because of the many varieties of snakes,
more than a few of them being venomous. 
The insect world is equally fascinating
&mdash;
spiders that can kill a horse with an ankle bite,
praying mantises of exquisite composition and beauty,
bullet ants,
named so because their bite is more painful than being shot,
and too many other insects to name and describe.
The birds are glorious,
wild parrots and hummingbirds of magnificent color and beauty.
The Talamanca mountains are a magical place.
I've lived here for three years now,
continuing with my trade of technical writing through remote work.
I liberated myself from Toronto, 
Canada,
learned to grow food and raise animals,
and now I have fifty banana plants,
pineapple,
a large garden,
a pig pen,
a chicken coop,
and I'm thinking of raising rabbits.
I buy milk and cheese from a Nicaraguan neighbor with a cow.
In summation,
I utterly unplugged myself from my middle class upbringing in Ottawa and my twenty year career in technology in Toronto. 
I own my time.
This is a very beautiful feeling I wish on everybody.
Time is the real currency in a human life
&mdash;
time to read the classic books and sacred poetry,
time to meditate in a sacramental way,
time to walk my dog through the dirt roads and paths crisscrossing the mountains,
and time to do the work I want to do.
Then something truly odd started.
I began getting visits from UFOs.
My neighbors took pictures of large orbs over my house and showed them to me.
Something started happening inside the house.
There was a weird smell,
something like copper, 
rubbing alcohol,
and blood mixed together.
I had the distinct impression that something was visiting me.
It was around this time that I started to think back to the failed book project with John Edmonds.
I had also been reminded of John at the end of 2017 when his story went national in the press.
Everybody was talking about it,
most of the print media outlets and a lot of the broadcasters.
I reached out to him and we spoke briefly.
It was decided that we would start the book again and this time we would finish it.

I'll give you an overview of the story with the *New York Post*.

##Man desperately trying to sell his ‘alien-infested’ ranch

>By Gabrielle Fonrouge October 26, 2017 | 1:58pm	| Updated

>An Arizona man has put his ranch up for sale — because he says he’s been harassed for years by aliens who even tried to abduct his wife, reports said.
>
>John Edmonds, owner of the Stardust Ranch in Rainbow Valley, about an hour west of Phoenix, is a popular figure in the alien believers community and has publicized his purported encounters with extraterrestrials on Facebook, claiming it’s the reason he wants to sell his ranch, 12News TV reported.
>
>“They actually levitated my wife out of the bed in the master chamber and carried her into the parking lot and tried to draw her up into the craft,” he said, according to the outlet.
>
>“This is why I want to move!”
>
>He said that in the past 20 years, he has experienced many “strange events” involving aliens and claims to have killed more than a dozen extraterrestrials on his sprawling ranch.
>
>
>
>A photo posted to his Facebook in March shows a bloodied samurai sword in a pool of what looks like dried blood from an alien he says he killed March 13. In another photo, he shows a picture of a wound on his calf and wrote that it came from an alien.
>
>“Wounds from recent attack here at Stardust Ranch upper right calf from battle with malevolent ET,” he wrote.
>
>The property has been featured on “Ghost Adventures” on the Travel Channel and has garnered international attention. He recommends anyone interested in the $5 million property be “very well-grounded.
>
>“It’s not something for a traditional family, but it holds a lot of secrets and what I believe are future opportunities to understand forces that are in the universe.
>
>“Please be very well-grounded because the energy here has the tendency to manifest with whatever is going on with you,” he said.


I can assure you that John's whole story has never been told.
There are aspects of it that he can't quite articulate to the headline seeking media,
or to television programs interested only in the paranormal.
This is the whole story of Stardust Ranch.
