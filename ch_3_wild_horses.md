Wild Horses and Strange Lights
=================================

To the best of my recollection,
those were the three things that were most strange in our first few months at the new ranch:
the entire previous owner's house contents in the swimming pool,
the man who killed monsters,
and the strange but amusing history lesson by the Southwest Bell serviceman.


Looking back on it now,
these two decades and some later,
I am forced to admit that Joyce's intuition was razor-sharp.
Much like the wife of the man who built the original building and guest house,
my wife never quite settled into the ranch in Rainbow Valley.


Our days were very different,
Joyce and I.
I would wake up every morning at around 4:30 AM,
prepare breakfast and coffee for Joyce,
while she got ready for work,
then she came out to the kitchen,
ate her breakfast with me,
and left for work.
She had a long commute into Phoenix,
another incidental tax I put upon her,
another sacrifice she made for me.
The work at the FBI was satisfying for her,
and we needed the money to keep our lives going.
I had paid for the ranch,
and I was staying home at the time,
burned out from years of social work with drug addicts,
homeless people,
army veterans,
and a host of other misshapen people who had been deformed by life's vicissitudes.


I had four pairs of male-female Rottweilers when Joyce and I moved to Rainbow Valley.
I'd always loved the breed,
and with the ranch I was able to give them the perfect life.
After Joyce went to work every morning,
I would take the dogs out and let them run around for a bit.
I would feed and water them and give them all their individual attention.
If there were any errands to be run in town,
I would choose one of the couples,
throw them in the truck with me,
and go do my errands with them.
The rest of the time they were in the kennel.
My love of animals has always been a big part of my life,
and it was also a big part of why I wanted to get a ranch.


A lot of time was spent tinkering around the ranch,
fixing fences,
doing small repairs,
a little bit of interior redesigning,
and general maintenance.
There was fence to be built,
horse gear to be oiled and polished,
stables to be cleaned,
and a whole host of things too numerous to list here
&mdash;
you get the point.
There was always something to keep me busy,
always some improvement to be made.
People who own farms get like this.
It's like maintaining a home just much larger.
Throw the animals and their shelters and habitations into the mix and you have non-stop work,
none of it life and death,
none of it absolutely necessary, 
but all of it strangely comforting,
the work of the soul one might say,
the fulfillment of the old Protestant adage that idle hands are the work of the devil. 


I became more curious about the hundreds of square miles of empty desert and red rock mountains around me.
I had a Jeep four by four,
and I decided to do a little off-road exploration.
I would drive in any direction over the dry,
barren land of the desert,
which I found most beautiful at dawn and dusk because of the ribbons of color in the sky and the sun coming up or going down behind the mountains.
It's a certain kind of person who finds contentment in barren places.
The desert has always been a place for hard-nosed people.
I imagine it's similar at the North Pole,
the commonality being a simple and endless pallet for the vision,
one a yellow-orange sandy forever and the other an endless field of ice.


I don't remember exactly when it was that I started to notice the lights in the sky.
Arizona has always been a Mecca for the New Age movement and a certain kind of person taken with the unexplained.
These are the people who migrated to Arizona from other parts of the United States and the world,
that's not to diminish the flocking of Canadian retirees looking for something different from Florida,
or the people born and raised in the state and accustomed to its high strangeness,
but mixed in with them are these spiritual migrants,
these seekers,
these imaginative zombies enraptured by the siren song of the mysterious.


The only way I can properly describe the lights that I saw in the sky is to say that they seemed to be alive.
They seemed to be conscious,
self-directed,
and they could do things lights shouldn't be able to do.
The predominant color of the lights was orange,
but there were other colors as well.
They could move across the sky faster than anything in nature or anything that human beings have made to travel in the sky,
including fighter jets.
I did learn early on that there was a military base twelve miles away on the other side of the mountains,
but these lights were not any kind of military craft.
From my vantage in the Jeep,
they looked like fireflies,
however,
the distance they were away from me in the sky and off on the horizon would mean that their actual size was much larger than a firefly.
I won't even try and guess how big the lights were.
I would watch them dance around in the sky and move across the horizon in a second.
Sometimes it seemed to me that they could just disappear and reappear miles away in an instant.
They were hypnotic to watch,
not solely by their movement and the oddity of what they might be,
but just in the general sort of way the human mind will go into a trance when it is captured by the rarefied emotions of wonder and awe.
Put simply,
they left me slack-jawed.


I remember my wife getting home from work and me telling her about what I had seen out in the desert,
which made me look like a damn fool.

Are you sure that's what you saw? she'd ask.

It's a curious aspect of human beings,
our nature,
and our behavior,
that we disregard anything outside the normal human experience that we have not experienced ourselves.
I suppose you could call that sane,
but in another way it seems like a limitation.
Anybody who has not experienced the haunted house is skeptical about the entire notion of ghosts.
Certainly,
if you've never seen a Bigfoot you're going to remain skeptical,
and,
going by the reaction of my wife in those early months at Stardust Ranch,
the same goes for lights in the sky that move in a way that no object made by man can move.
Of course this was just the beginning of our sojourn at Stardust Ranch.
My wife would join me soon enough as an experiencer. 



##Adopting Horses

One of the natural treasures I discovered in the desert was a horse population.
They were thin and malnourished
Food and water were hard to come by in that barren and scrub land.
The horses were not wild.
I don't know where they came from.
Perhaps various ranchers had let them go into the desert to die,
not knowing what else to do with them,
and not wanting them anymore.
They were skittish and reserved when I would drive close to them in the Jeep.
My heart opened,
and I decided that I wanted to help these horses.
So I went into Buckeye,
and I bought some hay,
and I filled a couple fifty-gallon barrels with water,
and I put the hay and the water in a trailer,
and I towed the trailer off-road into the desert where I had seen the horses.
They were able to smell the hay right away and came in completely devoid of the fear and hesitation they'd had when I showed up without food.
Once they got used to being fed and watered it was no problem at all to get them to follow me back to the ranch.
I drove slowly with a little bit of hay in the trailer and some two dozen horses ambled behind me and came back to my ranch.
I easily corralled them and took it upon myself to restore their health and make them useful and loved animals.
Some of them needed to see a veterinarian,
so I called the vet and he came out and examined my animals.
I told him where I had found the animals and he said that,
in fact,
it was ranchers who let them go.
What a sad state of affairs when a horse came to such a state.
I believe what Cormac McCarthy,
the great American novelist believes,
that a horse has a nearly human soul.


The animal aspect of running a ranch was beginning to fulfill itself with the discovery of the horses.
With a little help from my neighbors and a little bit of research,
I was able to bond with the horses,
settle them down,
and get them in a trusting relationship with me.
I was very happy with this.
I had come with the eight dogs and I wanted to get more,
and I knew that I wanted to get horses,
but I didn't know how I would go about doing that.
I could always go to auctions and buy horses,
but that seemed a little bit expensive,
and I didn't even know what I was looking for.
The fact that I could just get into my Jeep,
go out into the desert,
befriend wild or abandoned horses by bringing a little bit of feed and water,
then have them follow me back to the ranch and go into a corral,
was the most pleasant surprise of my new experience at the ranch.






##Luke Air Force Range

Just on the other side of the mountain was the Luke Air Force Range,
which later came to be named,
The Barry Goldwater Air Force Range.
I would soon find out that it was common for the government to use the military range as an excuse for reported lights like the ones I saw regularly.
They would tell people who saw the lights in the area that they were just flares and were part of military drills.
The range was used for fighter jet bombing practice.
It is true that there were lights and there were night lights associated with night drills,
but that didn't come anywhere close to explaining what was going on with the lights in the sky.
There were also times during the day when I was out in my Jeep that I saw fighter jets engaging lights,
but they were no match for the fast-moving lights which could turn one hundred and eighty degrees at unbelievable speeds.


During these first few months on the ranch,
I got to know some of the neighbors and some of the people in town where I did business.
There was a kind of *hush* about people in this part of Arizona.
I don't know how else to describe it.
If you were an outsider,
it was like you had come to some kind of haunted village,
and,
if you didn't figure out it was haunted on your own,
nobody wanted to be the one to tell you,
so when you spoke to people,
especially when you hinted at things like the lights in the sky,
there was a hesitation before they would get into any kind of dialogue with you.


People were wary of the military base on the other side of the mountain.
They certainly didn't accept the explanations given by the government for the strange lights in the sky.
I also began to get a sense of other things that were not quite right in the valley.
People would hint at things
&mdash;
bumps in the night,
disturbing animal mutilations,
people leaving town quickly,
and veiled references to my property
&mdash;
but they wouldn't come right out and tell you anything until they knew you could handle it.
I got it.
I was going through the same thing with Joyce.
I'd walked into a place that was like a *Twilight Zone* episode,
or the entire television show in one county.
Welcome to Arizona.
In that kind of atmosphere people retreated into themselves.
If you asked about something like the lights in the sky while in the hardware store,
you might get a polite affirmation
&mdash;
yeah, there were lights in the sky in that part of Arizona
&mdash;
but no deep conversation about what might really be going on,
nothing beyond agreement with your observation.



There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the US Military and Government are completely aware of the extraterrestrial presence in our country and the world and that they are having engagements all the time.
Why they persist in the *see nothing-know nothing* public narrative is a mystery to me.
They've been using the training drill excuse for the lights in Arizona for decades now.
The people who have seen the lights know by their own experience that they are not related to any military technology,
and it sows doubt between the governed and the government,
like the phony Sons of Gestapo story they tried to force-feed people.
It had more holes than a termite infested tree.
The flare excuse is the most ridiculous.
If they were in fact flares that were causing the lights in the sky then there would be a lot more fires in the desert.
The desert is extremely dry and there's a lot of combustible material out there.
You can start a desert fire just throwing a cigarette down on the ground.



##Goldwater and Arizona


Arizona has been a part of the UFO narrative since it came into existence.
Extraterrestrials do not enter the human narrative in any significant way until after the Second World War.
I had been living in Glendale before I bought the ranch.
I knew the stories.
I was really just not a UFO guy.
It's not that I dismiss them,
they just weren't a great draw for me.
I'd always thought of UFO people as having nothing else going on in their life,
people drawn into a fantasy world,
like the Dungeons & Dragons people,
or comic book people,
or people who watch too many movies.
I'd always had too much going on in my life to be that guy.
Nonetheless,
it was impossible to move to Arizona and not hear about UFOs.
I didn't know at that time in late 1996 and early 1997 that I was going to be drawn into the UFO world and become something of a spokesperson for it.

There is an irony in the air force base being named Barry Goldwater. 
Goldwater, 
a five-time US senator from Arizona, 
was one of the most outspoken government officials about the possibility of a UFO cover-up by the government.

In 1978, Goldwater said in an interview:

>The subject of UFOs has interested me for some long time. About ten or twelve years ago I made an effort to find out what was in the building at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base where the information has been stored that has been collected by the Air Force, and I was understandably denied this request. It is still classified above Top Secret.

In 1988 he was asked on *Larry King* if he believed the government was withholding information on extraterrestrial life. He responded:

>I certainly believe in aliens in space. They may not look like us, but I have very strong feelings that they have advanced beyond our mental capabilities... I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about &mdash; and probably never will unless the Air Force discloses them.


When you move to Arizona you hear the UFO lore over casual conversations with the residents.
The first really good picture of a UFO was taken in Arizona by a guy named William Rhodes on July 7th, 1947.
Rhodes went through the same kind of discrimination that officialdom is want to do when somebody in the civilian world has hard proof of a UFO.
Much like the Bob Lazar case from Area 51,
Rhodes had a relationship with the military industrial complex that they wanted to deny.
He claimed that he worked on some military projects related to cutting-edge technology,
and that he had the equivalent of a PhD.
Rhodes himself wrote:


>Additionally, after being thoroughly investigated by the FBI, I was issued top-secret status. Not even my wife was to know. The creation was a method of neutralizing the earth's magnetic field in ships. Not a single ship or sailor was lost to magnetic mines during the war's remainder. One day, my boss summoned me to his office and explained: "We have a total absence of degree'd doctorates, and having already passed requirements, you have been selected to receive a Ph.D in Physics. The degree would be known by the nickname "90 Day Wonder", and my work would not be disrupted to gain it.

This revoking of top secret clearance and complete disavowal once a person goes public with material related to UFOs is standard operating procedure in the UFO world. 
It's the same story with Bob Lazar and Area 51.
There was the alleged crash of an alien craft in Roswell,
New Mexico,
the neighboring state.
The commonality was the desert and the time.
There has been a lot of nuclear testing in Nevada,
and the desert of America's southwest seem to be some kind of nodal point for flying objects that can not be identified.
Rhodes had his negatives taken by an unidentified government agency that never returned them.


The next big event in UFO lore for Arizona was an alleged crash of an alien craft in a place called Dreamy Draw.
It happened three months after the Roswell crash and the UFO was allegedly buried under a damn which still operates to this day.
Then comes the first recorded abduction,
Travis Walton in 1975.
He was in a truck with a half-dozen other men and they saw a UFO.
Walton got out of the truck and walked over. 
According to the other men,
a beam of blue green-light came out and knocked Walton unconscious and pulled him into the craft.
His co-workers drove away hastily.
Walton was gone for five days,
reappearing naked and traumatized by the side of a highway,
claiming he saw the craft take off,
and telling a tale of brown-eyed aliens that had abducted him.
He later wrote a book called *Fire in the Sky* that documented the whole experience,
and it has become mandatory reading for the cult of UFO aficionados.
A movie was subsequently made. 


By far the most known UFO story in Arizona takes place shortly after I bought the ranch,
and here I am talking about the Phoenix Lights in 1997,
witnessed by thousands of people in the state and recorded by media outlets.
And once again the government gave little information or credulity to the idea that this was a UFO experience.
They prefer to talk about weather and gas in the sky or any other kind of pseudo-scientific reason that might take away from the credulity of UFOs and extraterrestrials in the human experience.


##Fiction and Non-Fiction

Human beings usually engage difficult topics first through fiction.
A human being will contemplate anything that's put in front of them in a Jules Verne novel,
a comic book,
or a TV series.
As I went about Arizona,
trying to find answers for what was happening on my ranch in those first few months,
I ran up against tight-lipped government agencies,
a sheriff's office under Joe Arpaio that treated me like I might be mentally insane,
and neighbors who just sort of looked away for the most part when the topic was brought up.
Don't get me wrong,
there are always exceptions.
There are people willing to talk about anything,
and there were people in the area who had experienced events similar to me.


Through the entire time that I was trying to come to an understanding of what was going on in Rainbow Valley,
and specifically at my ranch,
people were enraptured with what was I believe the number one show on television at that time,
*The X-Files*.
In the show,
the FBI has a secret division for paranormal cases.
A male and a female FBI officer team up together,
one a believer,
because his sister was abducted by aliens,
and the other a hardcore skeptic and rationalist in the form of a medical doctor.
It's a tried-and-true device for using difficult material to filter through a logical mind.
The believer was Agent Mulder,
played by David Duchovny.
The skeptic was Agent Scully,
played by Gillian Anderson.


I felt like a third agent in that FBI division called the X-Files.
Everywhere I went I was stonewalled and told that what I was trying to tell people was crazy.
The truth is
&mdash;
this has taken time to understand over the years
&mdash;
after witnessing dozens of people come and stay at the ranch,
and their various reactions to the phenomenon at the ranch  
(keeping in mind that there were people who visited here and experienced nothing) 
is that fiction,
the suspension of disbelief but the failure to engage a full reality,
is a modality of consciousness by which we assimilate material that's outside our normal understanding of reality.


Some people have a buffer language to use,
like calculus.
The scientists can move into hypothetical regions of reality using calculus and forego the state of fiction or disbelief.
But in a certain sense even the math keeps it at bay,
keeps it from that part of their minds that truly understands something to be real at an experiential level.
It's one thing to figure out mathematically the theory of anti-gravity and to levitate a small disc,
as it is rumored the scientists at Area 51 did,
but it's another thing altogether to get into a disc and fly off into space.


Human beings have been grappling with the idea of life in the solar system,
the galaxy,
and the universe for about a hundred and twenty years.
The human imagination really doesn't get stoked until Jules Verne.
His speculative fiction allowed the human imagination to go places it had not been before.
He took us into the ocean with *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea*,
and he took us to the center of the earth with *Journey to the Center of the Earth*.
And then the idea of life on other planets is placed in front of us with Orson Welles' *War of the Worlds*.
Originally it was a radio broadcast.
It was so effective and compelling that people were put into a panic and preparing for an alien invasion.


The next big engagement of the human imagination as it pertains to life from other planets is *The Day the Earth Stood Still*.
There are many rumors about this film.
For decades now it has been suggested that this was a way of telling the public about President Eisenhower's secret treaty with aliens.
In any event,
the film had a very profound impact on the public.
Coincidentally,
both *War of the Worlds* and *The Day the Earth Stood Still* have been remade in the last twenty years.
*War of the Worlds* was remade by Steven Spielberg with Tom Cruise in the center role,
and this time it was a film and not a radio production.
The *Day the Earth Stood Still* was remade with Keanu Reeves.
It's almost as though the human imagination is being examined for its willingness and its ability to accept the idea that life from other planets have visited earth.


As you can well imagine,
I have a very different perspective on all of these things.
I've been forced to look long and deep into the phenomenon of extraterrestrial life due to my experiences at the ranch in Rainbow Valley, 
Arizona.
It's my belief that alien life has always been here.
Alien life is both negative and positive.
Just like we human beings,
the world of alien races has extremely negative and extremely positive actors.
