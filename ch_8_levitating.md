The Levitating Wife
=====================


I feel like saying,
*now the story gets weird*,
but if you have stayed with me this long,
it might be a bit of an understatement.
How much weirder could it get?
Wait for it.

Because I had trained myself to sleep rather lightly,
always on the watch for gray aliens in the bedroom,
I became aware of the fact that my wife,
Joyce,
was sometimes levitating in the middle of the night.
Always half sleep,
I had trained myself to open my eyes at the slightest disturbance.
Sometimes I would open my eyes for no reason at all.
It was one of these times
&mdash;
no reason at all
&mdash;
that I happened to see my wife floating three feet off the mattress in the master bedroom.
I thought I was dreaming at first.
I thought I must be still sleeping and dreaming.
I gave my head a shake.
I sat straight up.
No motion or sound I made seemed to disturb the trance that she was in three feet above the bed,
her nightgown sort of wafting in a light breeze.

I got up on my knees and placed my mouth level with her ear.
I called her name several times
&mdash;
Joyce,
Joyce,
Joyce
&mdash;
to no avail.
She was in a state of consciousness that was deeper than sleep.
I put my arms all around her body,
on the top and bottom,
at her feet and at her head.
There were no strings or devices holding her up.
I decided I had to do something drastic.
I grabbed her by the shoulders and called her name very loudly
&mdash;
Joyce! 
She opened her eyes.
I applied pressure downward on her shoulders,
and she came back down to the bed.
She looked at me as though she was dreaming.
She closed her eyes and went back to sleep.

The next morning at breakfast,
I put her food and coffee in front of her and I said,
Sweetheart,
do you remember levitating three feet off the bed last night?

An incredulous look crossed her face,
No,
She said.

Joyce,
dear,
you were levitating three feet off the bed last night,
completely asleep,
in a horizontal position.
It was like a magic act,
some David Copperfield stuff.

I broke through her in incredulity.
Are you serious?

I'm afraid so,
I said.

How can I levitate?

We held eye contact for about thirty seconds in silence.
It was another question we couldn't answer.



It started to happen more and more.
I would wake up and Joyce would be levitating above the bed.
It reached a point where I would find her levitating in positions other than above the bed.
Sometimes I would find her levitating and moving slowly.
She was always moving toward the bedroom door.
In these instances I would have to get out of bed and go and lay a hand on her ankle and stop whatever traction motion was pulling her away from the bed.
One time I caught her in the middle of the hall.
I woke up and she wasn't in bed,
I saw no light in the bathroom off the master bedroom,
so I assumed she was somewhere else in the house in the middle of the night.
Curious,
I got up and went to look for her.
She was halfway down the hall toward the screen door,
levitating and moving slowly,
and when I say slowly,
I mean a little bit slower even than a walking pace,
perhaps the walking pace of an old lady with a walker.

In every instance,
once I finally got her to open her eyes,
she would slowly descend to the floor,
sit up,
then stand up,
and calmly walk back to bed.
In each of these instances she had no recollection the following morning at breakfast of what had happened.
This,
as you might well imagine,
put a strain on our marriage.
Joyce had to believe that I was telling her the truth,
because she had no recollection of it.
Of course,
that said,
with everything we had seen going on at the ranch,
it wasn't a huge leap of faith for her to believe that she was levitating above the bed,
outside of the bedroom,
and down the hallway towards a final destination we did not know.
This finally reached a dramatic conclusion one night when I was unable to wake her up even by grabbing her ankles.
Nor was I able to stop the slow movement three feet off the ground,
down the hallway,
and out the side wall
&mdash;
she went right through the wall.
All I could do was walk beside her to see where the traction beam was taking her.
When I got outside,
using the door,
I looked up and there was a metallic disc in the air,
maybe a hundred feet off the ground,
and maybe a hundred feet in diameter,
and out of it was coming a blue-white light.




I ran back into the house and got an AK-47.
Joyce was moving underneath the center of the disk.
The blue-white light was still fixed on her.
I trained the AK-47 on the source of the light underneath the disk.
I opened up with the banana clip,
which,
for those of you who don't know guns,
is two clips taped together upside down,
so that when one runs out,
you pull it out quickly,
turn the clips 180 degrees and reinsert into the AK-47.
Whatever I did,
it worked.
The blue  white-light disappeared and Joyce was dropped to the ground.
This time she did wake up fully.
This time she did have a full recall of what had happened.

##Looking for Answers

My introduction to and movement into the world of exopolitics continued under the tutelage of a man named Captain Robert Collins.


His biography reads as follows on the Coast-to-Coast website,
a popular syndicated national radio station which deals with fringe topics:

>Robert Collins was career Air Force serving in the fields of Avionics, Ground Communications, Engineering Physics and Intelligence (Foreign Technology Division, Wright-Pat) gaining an in-depth understanding of all the career fields. After 22 years he left public service to pursue the subject of UFOs full time living on Air Force retirement supplemented by odd jobs. In his many adventures within the Air Force he was turned onto the world of UFOs by Ernie Kellerstrass in 1985. Ernie was a retired AF Lt Col who worked at the FTD (Foreign Technology Division) until retiring. After performing some research he concluded that the government UFO cover-up was real and went to great lengths to uncover the cover-up which spanned over 60 years.

Collins was absolutely fascinated by my story at Stardust Ranch.
He understood the implications right away.
He was familiar with the Bradshaw Ranch and the Skinwalker Ranch,
and he knew both had been largely closed off to public scrutiny and the scrutiny of independent UFO researchers like himself.
He did his very best to court me and bring me into the UFO world with my unique story.



Collins introduced me to a man by the name of Peter Gersten who lived in Phoenix at the time.
Gersten had made a name for himself taking the government to court through the Freedom of Information Act to force the release of documents related to UFOs.
He was quite fascinated with my material as well,
Gersten admonished me to make postings to his website,
which at the time was called Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS),
with a similarly named website.

The mission statement,
still available online today,
reads:


>Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) is a
>nonprofit corporation which stands for two principles:
>
>#. It is against any and all secrecy relating to contact with all forms of extraterrestrial intelligence
>#. It believes that the public has the absolute and unconditional right to know about this contact.
>
>
>CAUS believes that the people on this planet are (1)  being contacted, directly and indirectly, and will continue to be contacted at an ever increasing rate as we approach the galactic alignment; and (2)  we presently have the technology and resources to discover the truth about this extraterestrial contact for ourselves and decipher these messages.
>Pursuant to these principles, CAUS is involved to specific projects to get the truth out:
>
>#. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit to be filed against the Army based upon the book "Day After Roswell" attributed to Lt. Col. (ret) Philip Corso.
>
>#. "Project:Destination Moon,' the first civilian, privately financed, rocket to the moon to send back live photos from Sinus Medii to verify alleged artificial structures located there
>
>#. The CAUS INITIATIVE, a viable and practical alternative to Congressional hearings, immunity and amnesty
>
>#. 'Beyond a Reasonable Doubt,' a promotional and fundraising video on behalf of CAUS.
>
>
>Other projects will involve:
>
>#. interpretation and analysis of crop circles data
>#. investigation and analysis of photos, videos and films of UFOs
>#. collection and analysis of channeled information.


Gersten made something of a name for himself in the UFO world when,
through a Freedom of Information Act case against the Central Intelligence Agency,
he managed to get some nine hundred documents released. 
An additional fifty-seven documents were withheld due to what the CIA called *national security*.


Like many in the UFO world,
he hasn't aged well.
*The Phoenix Times* had the following story in 2012.
Apparently Gersten had decided that a portal was going to open in conjunction with the Mayan calendar,
and,
if he leaped from a tall rock,
he would go through the portal and end up in another dimension.


The exopolitics world is full of people who go a little off their rocker.
There's something supernatural about the whole thing.
I have avoided that by just staying consistent with what I experienced and trying not to extrapolate too much.
However,
I do understand where Gersten was going with this.
There is a connection between our religions and our spiritual beliefs and the exopolitics world.

Here's Gersten in the 2012 article from *The Phoenix Times*.

>Wanders Home After Vortex Fails to Open

>ERIC TSETSI | DECEMBER 22, 2012 | 2:37PM

>Sedona resident Peter Gersten was left high and dry last night after a vortex failed to open at the base of Bell Rock, the popular red rock hiking spot. 
Gersten had been planning to leap into the "portal" last night. Instead, he apparently wandered home in an anticlimactic ending to his Doomsday stunt.

>"He went home," says Yavapai County Sheriff's Office spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn.

>"His earthly home in Sedona."



>Here's Gersten's original explanation of what he was doing on Bell Rock all day yesterday:

>"On the Winter Solstice of 2012 at exactly 11:11 UT a cosmic portal will open in Sedona Arizona and a leap of faith - from the top of Bell Rock - will 
propel me through its opening," he wrote.

>A couple months ago, Gersten told us in an e-mail, "I will be on the top of Bell Rock on 12-21-2012 from at least 11:00 am to either midnight or the 
manifestation of an extraordinary event - whichever comes first."

>Gersten, a retired lawyer -- who, at one point, became "professionally involved with the UFO phenomenon" -- detailed his lead-up to the opening of a portal at the base of Sedona's Bell Rock for at least two years.



Here's what Gersten himself said:


>Most of you will think that I am delusional and that my insane act will certainly result in my death. Death is inevitable - at least nowadays - and 100 
years from now it won't matter whether I died in 2012 or 2013 or even 2020. But I believe that some type of cosmic portal will be opening at that time 
and place and that an opportunity will present itself. I fully expect that it will either lead to the next level of this cosmic program; freedom from an 
imprisoning time-loop; a magical Martian-like bubble; or something equally as exotic.

>In March 2012 I will reach 70 years of age and nine months later we arrive at the cosmic coordinate. I think it will then be time for me to move on - in 
one form or another. I'd like to see what else our Cosmic Computer has to offer. Well, that's that. We can all get on with our holidays now.


I don't blame the media and the establishment for mocking a lot of the people in the UFO movement. 
They make fools of themselves. 
The entire way the UFO movement is brought forward is suspect from top to bottom.


Gersten encouraged me to send him stories about things that had happened or were happening on my ranch for his website.
I complied.
It was one of the first places in the public sphere that I began to talk about my story.
It's necessary that you understand when a person is having these kinds of experiences there is a tendency to try to keep them private.
They are,
after all,
happening to me and my wife.
They are not happening to anybody else.
For that reason alone they remained very personal.
By this time,
I really had no choice.
I had to begin to talk about this in public.
I had to begin to look for help with this situation.





Another person of interest in the UFO world is Clifford Stone.
Like so many others he has a military background,
and,
like the others,
he waited until retirement to begin his work of *uncovering* the truth about UFOs and delivering it to the world.
Curious how that works. 
Here's his short biography from Gaia.[^5]

[^5]: https://www.gaia.com/video/clifford-stone-bio

>Clifford Stone has become a monumental figure in the disclosure movement. He served 22 years in the U.S. Army where he worked with an elite secret group which was dispatched to crash sites with orders to recover extraterrestrial craft, bodies and technology. He states that the recovery of these artifacts has allowed the U.S. government to make astounding advancements in science and technology which could benefit the world – if these discoveries were to be made public. He claims to have personally cataloged 57 species of alien life forms.

>His personal experience has made him a highly qualified expert in alien technology, black ops organizations/procedures, and the history of extraterrestrial contact.

>Since his retirement, Stone has become devoted to diligently searching government archives and amassing one of the largest private collections of authentic government documents pertaining UFOs and extraterrestrials. He seeks the release of the all of the evidence, information and materials which show that intelligent life has been visiting our planet, and influencing our government, for a long time.



The reason I bring Stone up at this point is that he had a unique experience in the UFO world that brings a spiritual dimension to it.
Stone claims that he acted as the principal communicator with an alien that the United States Government had recovered from a crash.
Stone developed a tremendous empathy for the being.
He spoke about this relationship years later in interviews after retiring from the military,
and he spoke very fondly of the alien.
The way he spoke about the being,
he seemed to raise it up to a higher order than human beings.
The principal characteristic of the being was its empathy for other beings and it's love,
which Stone said was much superior to an average human being.
It did not want to hurt anything.
Sensing Stone's sadness over a recent loss,
Stone claims the being arranged a meeting between himself and his dead son.


Now ask yourself this:
what kind of a physically present being could arrange a meeting between the living and the dead?
The world of UFOs and extraterrestrials is not what we are discussing in public at all.
It's my belief that the extraterrestrials do not travel vast distances to come to planet Earth.
Instead,
they use another means of movement that is beyond physical.
And they travel through the worlds that we live in after we drop our physical bodies.

Imagine the implications here.
Imagine the implications for the Vatican.
Imagine the implications for the Mormons.
Imagine the implications for virtually every religious teaching on this planet.
We are told fairy tales by men who wear robes about the world we live and the world we will occupy when we die,
and the extraterrestrials visiting us today may have direct experience they can share with us that redefines everything we know about life and death.
The truth is,
it's much closer to what Einstein said:
energy never dies it just changes form.


There are entire storylines out there in the UFO world which suggests that the extraterrestrials are the angels that visited us in the past.
The extraterrestrial phenomenon might be the baptism,
the initiation the human race has been waiting for.
According to Clifford Stone,
we're still too violent and primitive to interact with the vast majority of them.
The ones that are visiting us are of a lower order spiritually,
demons,
if you will,
to round out the religious allegory.



So the question persists:
what was happening at my ranch?
Why would Joyce and I be waking up with marks and brands on our body?
Why did the grays keep reappearing in the house?
Why was my wife floating down the hall,
through a wall,
and out the house,
to be taken up by a white-blue light into a disc?
What the hell was I interacting with and what did they want from us?


To round out the trans-dimensional motif,
let's entertain the idea that a human being exists on multiple dimensions at the same time,
the higher dimensions being unconscious to us because of the gross energies of our sense-mind life.
The way I have come to understand it is as follows.
If you went to the wildest place you could find in the world,
maybe Siberia,
maybe the rainforest where Bruce MacDonald,
my coauthor for this work,
lives,
you would see a perfect circle of life where no one expression of life was allowed to overpopulate because it was checked by another expression of life that consumed it.
This is the basic ecosystem they teach us in high school biology.
It's always a circle.
If it were not a circle the entire system would become unbalanced and would fail.
That is the principle of ecology and ecosystems.
Now,
understand that the parts of the human being that rest unconscious at higher states of awareness on other planes of existence emit energies of a psychic nature which are consumed by other beings that do not have a physical form,
or cannot take or manifest physical form without the energy they get from us.
Essentially,
this is the Gnostic story of the archons in the Gnostic bible, *The Nag Hammadi Library*.
We are a source of food at a non-physical level for entities of a decrepit nature that are gravitating towards us because of our low vibration,
our course emotions,
and our generally negative nature as human beings.
We are part of an ecosystem we do not yet understand.
