An Ominous Foreshadowing
==========================



I was born in the late nineteen-fifties and grew up in a bad neighborhood in Evanston,
Illinois.
I had to learn to be aware of my surroundings at all times.
There was a danger in violence all around me.
The only rest I had from this was visiting my grandfather in rural Arkansas.
He was a Cherokee Indian.
He lived on a small farm in the woods.
Somehow this dichotomy of the tough Evanston neighborhood and my grandfather's farm in the woods instilled in me a great dream of one day living in nature.
I grew up and I went to school and I became a psychiatric counselor.
In my early thirties,
I moved to Arizona,
opened up a practice there,
and met my wife Joyce.


In the mid-nineties,
I became tired of the hustle and bustle of life in Phoenix,
Arizona.
I wanted to realize my dream of owning a ranch and having horses 
and space that I could call my own with neighbors too far away to even hear.
My wife Joyce and I contacted a Realtor in Arizona and told him what we were looking for,
which was a decent-sized ranch of at least ten acres that had a large living quarter on it and the capability to build more.
Our budget was limited and therefore the more expensive ranch areas of Arizona were off-limits to us.
That left some of the more remote and undeveloped areas that had ranches in Arizona,
places like Rainbow Valley,
which was undeveloped and remote in 1996,
an unincorporated municipality outside of Buckeye,
nestled inside Maricopa County,
probably made most famous by Sheriff Joe Arpaio,
who branded himself a no-nonsense southern sheriff in the nineties and early part of the new century,
often making headline news for some of his positions on immigration and crime in general.
Joe was a storied man,
a former head of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) turned small-time sheriff.
Phoenix was about forty-five to fifty minutes away,
more if the traffic was heavy in the morning or at the end of the workday.
Despite the commute,
many people lived in Buckeye and worked in Phoenix.



Buckeye was incorporated in the late 1800s and started with a very minuscule population.
It now rests at about eighty-five to ninety thousand people.
If you look up Stardust Ranch on Google Maps you'll see that it sits within the municipality of Buckeye.
In the mid-to-late nineties,
Rainbow valley was an affordable part of Arizona
&mdash;
not many people who made their living in Phoenix wanted to drive that far out every morning and back in the evening.
Phoenix isn't like other large metropolitan areas that have commuter trains.
It's not Evanston or New York.
The southwest is just not like that.
You have to get in your car and you have to drive everywhere you want to go in the southwest.


After realizing my geographical limitations based on budget,
I was amenable to the Realtor showing me ranches for sale in Buckeye,
and that led me to Stardust Ranch.
Of course,
it wasn't named Stardust Ranch in the late nineties.
That's a name that it's taken on as its infamy has grown,
a name coined by myself and now known around the world.

If you look at Stardust Ranch in the satellite view of Google Maps,
you'll see dry hard land with very little green,
a kind of orange,
red,
and brown.
It's the kind of land that you'd see in an old west movie,
and when you have your feet on the ground in Buckeye,
that's exactly what it feels like.

Except for the house itself,
which is fairly modern,
my ranch looks like it's from an old west movie.
It's the kind of hard scab land that a man looking for true solitude would feel comfortable in,
and when I saw it I saw my dream.

It was everything I was looking for and more.
The main house had about three and a half thousand square feet;
it was palatial,
a real ranch that could have visitors, 
horseback riding lessons,
an animal shelter,
anything I had dreamed.
There were five bedrooms and three bathrooms,
a large storage room,
a huge living room,
and a great kitchen that Joyce loved.
The construction was fairly new,
no more than fifteen or twenty years,
and everything was in great condition,
including the in-ground pool in the back.
It seemed too good to be true.
The price was extremely low for the amount of space we were getting,
both the house itself and the ten acres that attended it,
all fenced off and ready for horse training.
There was also a large stable in the back that could easily accommodate twenty horses.
The whole time the Realtor was showing me the property I kept thinking,
what's the catch?
He described it as the deal of a lifetime.
The funny thing about wanting something really badly and then having it put right in front of you is all your discernment goes away.
You don't ask intelligent questions.




My wife Joyce,
who I had only been married to for a few years at the time,
was not as taken with the place as I was.
Right from the first visit,
she had a bad feeling about the place.
I was blinded by my desire.
My intuition had been muted by my excitement.
There were more than a few long conversations at our home in Glendale before we agreed to buy the ranch.
I don't know why Joyce was so averse to the place.
I do now.
I didn't then.
She was just expressing her intuition.
She had a very bad feeling about the place right from our first visit.
It created a little tension in our fairly young marriage.
Part of me thought that she was trying to quash my dream.
She was not the country bumpkin I was.
She didn't want to continue to work in Phoenix with the long commute from the ranch.
I thought she was being selfish.
She thought I was being selfish.
Neither of us knew back then that it had nothing to do with selfishness or whose dream about how we would live would win out.
Joyce's intuition was dead on.
It always has been.
I was too young and too stupid to attend to that intuition back then.

Part of the dream of the ranch for me was a new revenue stream.
I had a million and one business ideas for the place.
I was already in my mid-to-late thirties a bit burned out from my social work practice.
I wouldn't call it a midlife crisis.
I was thirty-seven years old when we took the place.
It was enough time for me to grow sour on counseling.
I didn't want to live my life listening to other people's problems all the time.
I enjoyed helping people,
there's no doubt about that.
If you have ever worked in the therapy fields,
psychology,
counseling,
psychiatry,
it's extremely toxic.
It takes a part of you away.
I really enjoyed what I had done with my skills as a counselor.
I was very proud of the people I had helped in my life,
but it's not how I saw my life continuing.
I was more of a hands-on kind of guy.
I wanted to feed horses.
I wanted a large dog kennel with nothing but Rottweilers.
I wanted nature,
and I wanted freedom.





When we saw the ranch it was fully occupied.
We didn't meet any people,
but it was fully furnished.
The Realtor told us that the family used it as a vacation property but didn't live there full-time.
I mean it was really decked out.
There was beautiful leather furniture in the living room.
There were rugs to-die-for.
The walls were adorned with art,
albeit unoriginal art,
most of the stuff was prints,
but it was nicely framed and tastefully laid out.
The kitchen was completely stocked.
There were blenders and mixers and toasters and toaster ovens and a beautiful oven and microwaves and a gorgeous eating table,
a solid wood dining room table with eight chairs.
The bathroom closets were fully stocked with nearly new towels,
hand cloths,
a six-month supply of hand soap and shower gel and hair shampoo.
Every room was finished.
The bedroom sets were really elaborate.
There was expensive outdoor furniture around the in-ground pool.
The place showed really well.
It was a massive moving job for whoever was selling the place.
It seemed like a lot of money and one had to wonder where they were going to put all the stuff if this was just a second house they vacationed in,
as the Realtor had told us.



In the end,
it was the price that made it the selection to fulfill my dream to live on a ranch.
I believed my capable hands could turn it into anything I wanted it to be.
I was just happy for the land and for the opportunity to live in solitude and to get away from the city of Phoenix.
The deal was inked,
the contract signed,
and cash was paid.
I put my entire life savings into the place.
Joyce and I were given the keys.
I began all of the tasks related to moving into the house.


##Pool Contents


About a month later,
Joyce and I packed up and loaded all of the contents of our old home into the rental truck and drove out to the new ranch.
We had been given the keys just a few days earlier. 
I still remember that day driving down Tuthill Road in the rented U-Haul truck packed with all of my contents.
I had this incredible lightness in me.
I felt like a kid on Christmas morning.
I can still remember clearly the first time I unlocked the front gate with the U-Haul truck idling behind me.
I undid the chain and pushed the two gates open.
I looked back at Joyce who was driving behind the truck in our car.
I had a big smile on my face.
She smiled back.
I think she was just infected with my happiness.
She had reconciled herself to living at the ranch,
but she was not entirely comfortable with it.
I drove the U-Haul truck down the long dirt laneway,
my eyes glued to the large house.
I was beaming with pride.




When we opened the door and walked into the house,
we were startled to realize that none of the contents of the house had been removed.
My first thought was that the family that had sold the ranch to us had changed their mind;
they didn't want to move.
I was flabbergasted,
frustrated,
and moving quickly to extreme agitation.
What in the hell was going on?
It was extremely unprofessional of the Realtor.
He got a damn good commission,
and he moved a property that had been on the market a while because of the location.
Joyce was curious but not frustrated.
She laughed a little.
It broke the tension and I broke down and chuckled.
With all the contents of the house still there we had nowhere to put our contents for the house.
I'd rented the truck for twenty-four hours.
There was a penalty for breaking the contract.
It cost more to keep the truck an extra day without a contract than it did to contract the truck,
commitment to other customers I suppose.
I was in a jackpot on what was supposed to be a happy day,
a day I might look back upon for years,
the day I took possession of my ranch.

Stay cool,
Joyce said.
It's no big deal.


With the rental truck in the laneway and Joyce by my side,
I took out my cell phone and called the Realtor.
I told him what was going on.
He was incredulous.


Really?
he said.

Everything,
I said.
Even the television.

The kitchen?
he asked.

Everything,
I repeated.


He suggested we go for lunch,
see a movie,
kill a few hours in nearby Buckeye,
or go for a drive
&mdash;
anything to kill some time
&mdash;
and he seemed convinced he could settle the problem by the evening.
It was about eleven o'clock in the morning.

Joyce and I did just that.
We left the rental truck and drove in our car,
went to town,
had a nice lunch,
saw a movie
&mdash;
*Mission Impossible* with Tom Cruise
&mdash;
did a little window-shopping,
then,
early in the evening,
we returned to the ranch.

Upon entering the home,
I was surprised to see that the entire house had been cleaned out,
which was no small job.
I was frankly amazed that the Realtor was able to pull it off.
By that time it was late in the evening and we decided that we were going to start moving the contents of the rental truck into the ranch in the morning.
We brought in a mattress to sleep on the floor,
but,
before I went to bed,
I decided to survey the property.
I turned on the outdoor light for the backyard and walked out under the desert sky.
When I looked down,
I was astounded to see all of the contents of the house
&mdash;
the refrigerator,
the washing machine and dryer,
every piece of furniture,
all the utilities and appliances from the kitchen counter,
mixers and blenders,
everything that had been in the house
&mdash;
in the dry in-ground pool.
It was a truly perplexing circumstance.
If the old owners of the ranch,
or someone acting on their behalf,
had come to the house to move the contents,
why did they put it all in the pool?
It would have been easier and less distance to walk with the heavy utilities and furniture to a truck.
Whatever cost the labor and the truck would have been could easily have been offset by selling the furniture at a local second-hand store or giving it to friends or family.
There was absolutely no rhyme or reason for everything that had been in the house being in the pool.

I went in the house and got Joyce.

That doesn't make any sense,
she said upon seeing the pool full of expensive house contents.

I know, right?
I said.

There's thousands of dollars of appliances and furniture,
she said.

Close to ten thousand or more,
I added,
as the two of us stared at the pool like we were hypnotized by a car crash. 



The only thing that came to my mind was that the Realtor had paid some unreliable labor to do the task.
I called him back.
He assured me that this was not the case.
He had been unable to make an arrangement to remove the contents of the house.

Well,
who the hell did this, then?
I asked sarcastically.

I have no idea,
the Realtor replied.

Did you get a hold of the old owners?
I asked.

No, the Realtor said.
Their contact number is no longer in service.

This is really weird,
I said.

You have some really nice stuff for free,
he said.

I have my own stuff,
I said.
What am I supposed to do with a pool full of furniture and appliances?

John,
he said.
It's not my problem anymore.
You paid cash for the house.
It's your house,
your problem.





It was an enormous task getting the stuff out of the pool.
I had to go to a tool rental depot and get a winch.
I'd never operated a winch before.
It took some time to get the hang of it.
I would put the really heavy,
cumbersome items,
like the refrigerator,
stove,
and washer and dryer,
on a dolly and wheel them to the end of the laneway.
I was pissed off. 
It was a lot of work.
I didn't put everything out in one day.
I put it out in drips and drabs and let people drive by and pick it up at their own pace.
It took about three weeks to get rid of all the contents of the pool.
To this day it remains a mystery.
I have no idea who did it.
It defies logic.
It would have been more logical to just take the stuff.
Most of it was in excellent condition.
A salvage company would have loved to get their hands on it.
In hindsight,
I should have just called a salvage company or a second hand or vintage store owner,
explained the situation,
listed the contents of the house,
the brand names of the appliances,
and told them it was all in great condition.
They would have sent a truck with six guys in thirty minutes.
Instead,
I left it to the Realtor,
who really didn't care.
He made his commission.
There was nothing left in it for him. 




It took about a week to get everything the way we wanted it in the house.
It was a tonne of work.
I did all the heavy lifting myself.
The awkward stuff I moved with a dolly. 
The good thing about this home was that it was a ranch house
&mdash;
all one floor
&mdash;
so there were no stairs to lift things up.

Joyce persisted with her *bad feeling* about the ranch.
The pool fiasco did nothing to change her gut feeling,
the opposite;
it made her more suspicious of the place,
and it validated her intuition.
Her entire participation in the project was to satisfy me,
and I was extremely grateful.
It's not that she was against the idea of a long commute to Phoenix,
where she still worked in a clerical capacity at the Arizona headquarters of the FBI,
but rather the particular ranch we bought.
Looking back on it now,
I Was a fool not to follow my wife's intuition.
I was so possessed by the idea of realizing my dream of living in a peaceful and quiet place,
getting a few dozen horses,
starting a dog kennel,
running an animal shelter,
and living the life I had been dreaming about for years,
that I couldn't see what was going on around me,
and I couldn't relate to what my wife was feeling.

##The Man Who Killed Monsters


The experience with the contents of the house in the pool left me out of sorts.
I kept my thinking to myself and didn't share it with Joyce.
I don't know if I was just being paranoid,
but it suddenly dawned on me that there were aspects of living in such a remote location that I had not accounted for,
specifically safety.
I bought a gun,
a 357 Magnum.
I had never been a big gun guy,
but living in such a remote area,
where police response might be quite some time,
I decided it was prudent of me to have a weapon to protect myself and my wife.
Little did I know back then that I would come to arm myself in ways that I had never imagined.


I have waited so long to tell this story in its entirety,
and I didn't keep notes,
a diary,
or a journal of any kind,
all of my recollections are *best guess*.
With that said,
sometime in our second month at the ranch I was home alone while Joyce was at work in Phoenix.
I saw a man come off the road and begin walking up my long dirt laneway.
Right away I knew there was something off about him.
He was about five feet-nine inches tall,
and he wore a military-style shirt with the sleeves cut off over a t-shirt.
He had on a very well worn pair of jeans that looked as though they hadn't been washed in some time.
A very worn pair of lace black boots adorned his feet.
He had long gray hair parted in the middle
&mdash;
sort of like Willy Nelson
&mdash;
and somewhere between a one and a two-week salt and pepper beard over very gaunt cheeks.

I put the gun into the back of my pants and walked out of the house to meet him on the laneway.
As I got closer to him,
I could see an intensity to his eyes,
something I had come to equate with the many psychotics I met in my counseling practice.
His teeth were in horrible condition,
yellow and broken,
marking him as someone who had lived rough for a while,
years maybe,
but what caught my attention most was the well used twenty-four inch machete he was carrying in his hand.
He didn't appear to have a scabbard for it.
A man walking around with a machete was not out of place in Rainbow Valley,
but a man walking around holding a machete was unusual.

It made me tense up in the way I used to feel when I was walking around my neighborhood in Evanston,
as though anything could happen,
as though I had to be prepared for immediate and spontaneous violence.
We both came to a stop around the midpoint of the hundred-yard laneway,
ten feet between us,
squared off like a couple of gunfighters cautiously studying each other.
I spoke first.

Can I help you?

I live here,
he said.

Excuse me?
I asked.
I tried not to be rude or too incredulous because I didn't know what the guy was talking about.

He pointed up with the machete off to the distance,
stating he lived there.

I took a glance behind me.
I assumed he meant the storage shack about twenty-five fifty yards from the main house.
I'd already taken a look inside it.
I didn't see the makings of any kind of squat for this homeless man.
I had the sense that he was a veteran.
In any case,
I was extremely tolerant of him.

I'm sorry,
I said.
I don't have an arrangement with you.
Did the previous occupants allow you to live on the land?
Did you help out around here or something?

He then said something that made my whole body tighten up.

I kill the monsters.

I don't know why,
but even thinking back about this all those years ago,
makes me uncomfortable.
I quickly became impatient with the man.

Look,
I don't know what arrangement you had with the previous owners of this ranch,
but I don't want you living here.

He sort of cold-cocked me with a thousand-yard stare and simply said,
You're going to regret that.

Then he turned around and walked away as he had come.




Between the man with the machete in my laneway and the entire contents of the house being put in the pool,
I still did not connect with Joyce's intuition about the place.
I guess I should have seen it.
It could not have been a stronger forewarning by the law of circumstance and synchronicity.
The only thing missing was the crazy old man from the *Friday the 13th* movie franchise,
warning the teenagers not to go to Camp Blood.
