Bigelow and Bullets
=========================




With the increased notoriety of going public,
albeit only in the rather esoteric and basement world of exopolitics,
I came up on a lot of people's radars.
This was somewhat helpful in getting guidance and understanding from other people experiencing similar things,
but it was also extremely dangerous.
I had already been warned by the Men in Black to stop talking in public about what was happening at my ranch.
I didn't listen to them.
I don't obey well.
I've never been easy to scare. 
I was given mild caution by Captain Robert Collins and others I confided with.
They did tell me there were a lot of forces working against disclosure.
It's not like I wanted fame and fortune with my ranch.
When Bruce MacDonald was introduced to me in 2012 he seemed like a good fit for a book.
Others had approached me over the years,
but they had a vibe I can't quite describe,
&mdash;
creepy,
opportunistic,
and shady
&mdash;
Bruce was new to the field of exopolitics,
not that interested in the book,
and approaching it more as an act of service for Joyce and I.
I knew he was the Frodo I needed to carry my ring to Mordor. 
He took eight years to write the book.
The first time he tried the energy from the ranch found him and scared him off it.
The ranch can do that.
People who have come here report interacting with the energies years after they leave.
You get tagged when you experience the ranch.
You don't have to visit the ranch to get noticed by the energies and entities here.
Bruce got noticed just writing the book.
He went through the rage moods I had when I first moved here,
and he had visitation even on his mountain ranch in Costa Rica,
and all of it just by tuning his mind to the ranch through the act of writing the book. 



The Maricopa County Sheriff's Department came to know me quite well.
I was out in my work shed one day,
the shed that the man at the beginning of the story
&mdash;
the monster killer with the machete in my laneway
&mdash;
said he lived in,
working on a motorcycle,
sanding and polishing one of the metal parts,
when a large caliber bullet broke through the wood wall and whizzed past my head,
exiting the wooden shack through the back wall,
only the one bullet,
no second round.
I don't know how the person got the bullet so close to me without being able to see me behind the wall,
but they did.
I also don't know if it was a genuine attempt to kill me or just an attempt to scare me.




I would remind you at this point of the words from the Men in Black,
*Your name is John Edmonds and you're not to talk about aliens on Peter Gersten's website anymore*.
This felt like a follow-up to that conversation but with a different division of the US government speaking to me.
When you're in the world of exopolitics and you're going public with information that the government doesn't want public,
a lot of things are done to discredit,
intimidate,
and frighten you off your position.
Many people have been frightened off of their positions.
There are probably more lost voices in the UFO world than those who form the body of voices that have been the chorus of this information for the last four or five decades.
Most people just don't have the stomach for it.
It's dangerous.
It's harrowing.
It's difficult to have a normal life and give security to your loved ones,
and it's extremely frustrating.
So what keeps me going?
If I knew the answer to that I would tell you.
I just will not give up.
I drew my line in the sand early on.
I believe my life is fated and that all human lives are fated to a certain degree.
I was put into this circumstance.
I have an obligation to tell the world what is happening on my ranch.
Nobody was going to silence me.




After some time I left the woodshed,
went back to the house at a sprint,
grabbed a pair of binoculars that I keep in the house,
and scanned the hillside across from the house to see if there was anybody still there.
I knew that it was a sniper bullet that had gone through the walls.
Anytime you get one shot from a high caliber gun like that it's a sniper.
There was nothing that I could see in the hills.
I called the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department.
They came out and made a report.
I answered all the usual questions.

Does anybody want harm upon you or your family?

Not that I know of.

Do you owe any money?

I paid cash for my ranch and I don't have any debts in the world right now.

Do you have any idea why someone might want to take a shot at you?

It was at this point that I decided to keep my mouth shut.
What am I going to do?
Tell one of Joe Arpaio's deputy sheriff's that I have become a voice in the world of UFOs and abductions and the paranormal and that the Men in Black came to my house and told me to stop talking publicly about it,
and they walked right through the metal gate at the front of my laneway?
There's only so much a normal person can take.




One of the most frustrating things about being in the exopolitics world is that it's a lot like having mystical experiences.
There's very few people that you can share them with.
They're not part of the normal human experience.
Trying to share them with other people makes those people feel inadequate somehow.
Every human being at some level,
with very few exceptions,
feels as though they are the center of the world.
If they don't know something,
then it's not worth knowing,
and there's no way that the universe and all the powers that be would give these extraordinary experiences to someone else and not to them.
Everyone has a reality paradigm and their immediate conclusion is that you're crazy.
It can't be that you're experiencing a transdimensional reality for which they have no consciousness.
That would be a deficit or a deficiency in them.
Therefore,
it has to be you.
You're off your medication.
You're in the early stages of schizophrenia.
You're in some form of mental imbalance caused by stress or trauma.
Every encounter with the police and the silly and ridiculous line of questioning they give is so frustrating it almost equals the frustration of the events going on at the ranch themselves.


Some of you might ask,
quite fairly,
is the government really trying to suppress information about extraterrestrial incursions into our reality?
I think it's best to answer this with an analogy.
There are three ranches like mine on a direct line north and south.
The first is Skinwalker Ranch in Utah.
The second is the Bradshaw Ranch in Sedona, Arizona.
The final ranch is my ranch,
Stardust ranch,
the farthest south.
The Bradshaw Ranch is a curious location.
It has had a good book written about it, 
*Merging Dimensions: The Opening Portals of Sedona*.
It was bought by a Hollywood stuntman in 1945.
He opened up a photography business.
He also had a number of Hollywood movies shot on his land. 
Many of the old westerns from  the fifties were shot at the Bradshaw Ranch in Arizona.
The rolling red landscape and the cone like mountain structures made for excellent backdrops for the desolate western stories.
Bradshaw attracting Hollywood revitalized the entire area and there was a minor economy that flourished there.
Now,
here is what is curious about the Bradshaw Ranch.
It *activated* in 1992.
I use the word activate because there was no paranormal activity on this ranch until 1992.
After 1992 the stories are outrageous.
Many of them are similar to the kinds of stories you're reading in my book.
However,
the Bradshaw Ranch has things that are even weirder.
It is reported that raptors were seen walking around on the ranch.
Here I mean the five or six foot dinosaur from millions of years ago.
It is believed they came through a portal and left through the same portal.
As ridiculous as this might sound,
once the raptors disappeared,
the footprints were photographed.
The raptors were really there.
Here is where I prove my thesis about the government.
In May of 2003 the government approached the son of the original Bradshaw.
He had turned the location into a functioning cattle ranch.
They told him they were buying the ranch.
They gave their price.
They told him that if he did not sell they would requisition the ranch under federal law.
As you might well imagine,
he sold the ranch.
It is now run by the US Forestry service which keeps armed military men all around the perimeter.
Anyone trying to walk up to the fence will be shot.
Does that sound like a government interested in disclosing the phenomenon of magnetic fields,
portals,
and life from other dimensions?
Believe me when I tell you,
there is danger in going public with these stories.




The next incident at my ranch happened on a Friday night.
Friday nights have always been the night for Joyce and I to go out and do something.
Sometimes we went to visit friends in Glendale where we lived before we bought the ranch.
Sometimes we went to Phoenix for a meal at a nice restaurant and to see a movie.
Sometimes we went shopping.
The point is that it was couple time.
It was a time we had put aside in our rather busy and stressful week for us to be husband and wife and go and do something.
I looked forward to Friday nights quite a bit as did Joyce.
On this particular Friday night,
and I'm really trying to remember the timeline of my story here,
but this would have been sometime around 2009-2010.
When Joyce was finally ready,
we went out the side door to where the truck was parked in the parking area of the ranch.
As I was opening up the driver side door a loud crack commenced and we were under fire from what sounded to me like an AK-47.
Of course,
I know what an AK-47 sounds like because I owned AK-47s and I still own AK-47s.
Joyce and I immediately took refuge at the front of the truck and we crouched down behind the engine block.
Bullets whizzed all around us.
The shots were coming once again from the other side of the highway up in the hills.
I had my cell phone so I dialed the sheriff's department right away.
We sat behind that truck for about fifteen minutes waiting for the sheriff to come.
They came in full force.
I guess some of my neighbors a little ways off called the sheriff's department as well,
so there was no doubt on their part that there was an AK-47 being fired at us.




Again we went through the same line of questioning.
Joyce and I were separated,
as though this were some kind of a domestic dispute and they wanted to get two versions of the story.
I understood,
it's not that difficult to understand how cops think.
It's standard procedure in therapy as well to separate people and to interview them separately.
We told them everything we could tell them.
What more was there to tell?
We didn't know who was shooting at us.
We didn't have any enemies that we knew of.
We didn't owe any money.
There was nobody making claim on our land.
Nobody had come and made an offer on the land that we refused.
Joyce didn't have an ex-husband.
I didn't have a crazy ex-wife.
We became something of a curiosity to Joe Arpaio's Maricopa County Sheriff Department.




At the lower levels of government,
like a sheriff's office,
they're not read in on the deeper secrets that the government at the federal level keep to themselves.
They're just foot soldiers in the community trying to keep the peace.
We had become a troubling breach of the peace,
not by anything that we were doing,
but by what was being done to us.
So we had police cars in the neighborhood all the time after that.
It made us feel safe from the human problems.




I do wonder sometimes how they keep the lie going.
The Maricopa County Sheriff's Department must have had hundreds of calls about unidentified flying objects over the years.
It would be impossible to be in law enforcement,
receiving calls from the public,
and not know that parts of Arizona were a hotspot for paranormal activity.
Somehow the police always showed up and made it seem like there was nothing out of the ordinary and that your claim was profoundly unusual and that they had no corroboration from the neighborhood or from the county that anything that you were saying was even close to a public phenomenon.
Another thing that surprises me is that community groups have not formed in Arizona as a result of all of the paranormal activity.
There is something about the experience of being abducted or the experience of seeing a disc close to your home that renders you mute.
And here I mean mute to any kind of public conversation that might have a healing or understanding or expansion of knowledge and fact.
It seems to me sometimes that one of the side effects of encountering extraterrestrials is that you isolate yourself.
It's part of a general trend in human beings not to leave the herd.
I put it squarely on the police for not beginning a dialogue with the public about all of the high strangeness that was happening in Rainbow Valley.
In the end,
though,
when you give it a good think,
all they are really commissioned to do is protect life and property.
They have no role to explain things that are outside their job descriptions.



There was one time at the ranch where there was a giant black triangle hovering over Rainbow Valley.
A blind man could have seen it.
At that time,
and this would have been around 2005-2006,
I was still fairly secluded out there.
So there were no neighbors out on the street gawking at the giant black triangle with me.
I had Joyce call the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.
We told them exactly what was going on.
They sent a car out with a single sheriff's deputy.
He got out of the car and walked over toward me where I stood at the end of my laneway,
by the iron gate where the Men in Black had walked right through.
The deputy was wearing a rain jacket despite the fact that the sky was clear.
He had a plastic wrap over his police hat.
At first I thought maybe he was mentally retarded.
It seemed that stupid to me what he was doing.
Then it dawned on me.
He had been told to come out and answer the call but not to identify himself.
The rain jacket and the plastic wrap over his hat were to cover up his badge number.
He stood right in front of me communicating with dispatch through his walkie-talkie.
He confirmed that he was at the location of my ranch,
and he confirmed that there was in fact a giant black triangle hovering in the sky just above my ranch.
It was as big as a football field.
He told me there was nothing the sheriff's department could do to help me.
I told him that I wanted an official report so that I could have people understand what I was experiencing on the ranch was real.
He looked at me and he said there would be no paperwork.
And with that he turned and walked back to his cruiser,
got in,
and drove away.
Again,
I have to ask,
what is the chain of command in these bizarre *X-Files* type events in the world of policing from the federal agencies like the FBI down to local sheriff's offices?
Even standing on the street and watching one of the giant crafts with me,
a Maricopa County Sheriff's Deputy was not willing to put on paper that he saw it.







##The Big Man 




There were parties that were interested in what was going on at my ranch.
They just weren't public-sector.
In the latter part of the first decade of the new millennium I heard from Robert Bigelow,
chief executive officer a Bigelow Aerospace,
at that time one of the largest private aerospace companies in the world.




Bigelow was known to have a fascination with space,
extraterrestrials,
and the paranormal.
He was already scoping out the area before I bought Stardust Ranch,
and he had bought Skinwalker Ranch.
He gained a lot of fame through the stories that spread about paranormal activity very similar to what goes on at my ranch.
He bought Skinwalker for $200,000 and sold it in 2016 for 4.5 million.
The purchaser was a shell corporation nobody really knows anything about.




Now I want to be completely clear and upfront in this story.
What is being presented are my ideas and opinions.
If you want to consider me an expert for living on a paranormal,
extraterrestrial infested,
portal populated ranch in Rainbow Valley,
Arizona,
then yes,
at an experiential level,
you could probably call me an expert,
but you don't live through what I've lived through and not begin to research what's going on.
My disposition towards everything that's been going on around me has never been fear,
rather an innate curiosity to get to the bottom of it.
I try to see the phenomenon as rationally as possible,
so to understand the UFOs I did as much research as I could,
and most of it was first hand.
I reached out and contacted experts,
experiencers,
and abductees in the field.
As already stated in this story,
most of the people were doing late-night radio like Coast-to-Coast or publishing small websites.
The community wasn't really that strong.



Things really got interesting when Bigelow's people reached out to me.
It's hard to say what's going on with a guy like Bigelow.
My knee-jerk,
or my intuition,
is that he's a cooperating assistant to the government forces trying to cover up the UFO and paranormal phenomenon.
Why do I say this?
It's just based on observing his behavior.
He's really done nothing to increase the public's awareness about the phenomenon going on at these ranches,
other than hokey horror films and cryptic documentaries.
Consider this as well,
Bradshaw Ranch was forcibly taken by the government.
Why would they allow a civilian to own Skinwalker Ranch,
a civilian who owns am aerospace company,
and a civilian who is a billionaire?
He's contributed nothing to a furtherance of our understanding of the world and the dimensions that we live within.
Bigelow is with the shady agencies and departments that cover up what's going on.




Their *Who We Are* section of their website reads as follows.

So why is this guy the sole private entrepreneur buying transdimensional ranches?
Who knows for sure?
Anyway, Big Daddy Bigelow took an interest in my ranch.




The first group to reach out was a group associated with John Lear.
He's from the Lear Jet family.
He's an ex fighter pilot and big voice in the exopolitics community.
He was also very negative toward me.
He believed I was making everything up and that I was just trying to get attention.
And they were very nasty about it.
They called up on the phone and told me I was lying.
I guess I had reached a point in my journey where the world proper had to deal with me.
Believe it or not,
this world of extraterrestrials and UFOs is populated by a bunch of huge egos,
just like the book publishing industry,
Hollywood,
or big business.
People who have made their names in this world are very aggressive and very domineering when it comes to protecting their territory.
And as I have said already in my story,
so many of them have connections to the military and the intelligence communities that you really have to wonder what's going on.
Lear is another example of one of these goofballs who's half in and half out of the intelligence agencies.
Remember,
there's an old saying,
once you're in the CIA you're always in the CIA until you die.
There is no retirement from the intelligence community.
So I trusted John Lear about as far as I can throw him.



I'm out there on Internet radio and on chat boards and on UFO sites like Peter Gersten's and I'm talking about all of this phenomenon,
so sooner or later I had to be dealt with.
I was like a kid banging two trash can lids together at three o'clock in the morning on a suburban cul-de-sac.
One of the neighbors is going to come out or the police are going to show up sooner or later.
John Lear and his people ended up leading me to Bigelow.
He called me up and said, You want to sell the ranch?

I told him I'd love to sell the ranch.

He asked me how much I wanted.

I told him.

He made an offer.

The offer was far less than sufficient.


This bantering about price in buying the ranch went on for about six months to a year.
And then one day Bigelow called me up and said he'd like to send a team of people out to investigate the ranch,
and he said that if my claims were true he would buy the ranch.
We agreed to these terms.







Bigelow dispatched a team from Las Vegas,
the headquarters of Bigelow Aerospace.
On the appointed day I waited but nobody showed up.
I got a call from Bigelow's people from Las Vegas.
The vehicles he sent got as far as the bridge crossing over into Rainbow Valley and they broke down
&mdash;
all of them.
Bigelow's people told me that they would have to reschedule and that the vehicles in Rainbow Valley would have to be towed back to Las Vegas.







I didn't know what to make of their story.
I half believed it and half disbelieved it.
However,
Given my own history at the ranch and the surrounding area it was entirely plausible that all of their new vehicles broke down at the same spot at the same time.
Nonetheless,
one week later I was contacted and they wanted to send another team.
I agreed but told them that if anything happened all expense and liability was on their side, not mine.
They agreed.
A week later later the appointed team showed up.
They came into the house and did interviews with Joyce and I.
They asked a bunch of questions.
They recorded the interviews on video.
We were both given digital lie detector tests.



They asked me to reenact everything related to the killing of the first gray in the sunroom.
I did.
They stayed for two or three days and continued to ask questions.
They didn't live with us at the ranch,
They had a hotel close by.
They went around the property doing tests with some kind of electronic instrumentation.
They took hundreds of pictures.




After about a week they left.
I was promised a formal written report by Bigelow Aerospace.
No such report was forthcoming.
After about a week Bob Bigelow started calling.
He wanted to buy the ranch,
but his price was half of what we agreed upon to allow his team onto my land to do their tests.
So he changed the purchase price and he reneged on his word to give me a copy of the report.
Bob Bigelow is a scumbag.







I've continued to hear from Bob over the years.
Time and time again he calls me up and makes an offer on the ranch but it's too low.
It's been going on for years.
The funny thing is Bigelow has not published a lot of information in the public space about his research.
The one thing that bothers me the most about Bigelow and his company,
Bigelow Aerospace,
is that they are as secretive and non-cooperative as the government when it comes to this fourth dimension stuff,
hence my aforementioned opinion on aerospace billionaires and the government.







One of the more curious things that resulted from Bigelow's team going over the ranch is the theory that there is a UFO craft buried underneath the ranch.
At the time that Bigelow sent his team out,
he also made a request to excavate the ranch.
I told them there was no way I would allow that unless he bought the ranch.
Over the years I've received numerous claims from various people,
including airline pilots,
psychics,
and other people who just call me up to tell me there is a pulse coming from my ranch.



The Bigelow team made one more visit to the ranch,
two in total.
They took samples from the walls using a special light that pinpoints human blood.
They were interested in tissue samples.
In the time I had been living at the ranch I had killed numerous grays.
A number of them with my samurai sword,
and a number of them with my bare hands,
picking them up by the ankles and just smashing them into walls.
And so there was gray fluid all over the place.
I didn't have any bodies for them.
The bodies kept disappearing out of my freezer.
How that happened, you might ask?
Probably the same way my car keys would disappear and then drop on top of my head a couple days later.
What do you want me to say?
Things are phasing in and out of the reality of my home.
But they weren't able to clean up the tissue samples.
Bigelow did call back and did say that he was interested in buying the ranch.
He did not offer me the price that we had agreed upon if his tests were verified.
He confirmed that the tests returned results that were commensurate with the phenomenon I was describing.
I will give him that.
What he did not give me was an actual paper copy of the report done by his team.
And for that I call Bob Bigelow a liar.
He continues to call from time to time making inquiries about the ranch and still pitching me a lowball offer.
