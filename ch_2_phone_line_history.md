Phone Lines
===================================


In keeping with my home defense motif,
I decided we needed a landline telephone.
Both Joyce and I had cell phones but a landline was added security.
One of the odd little things I noticed when looking at the house was an unusually large number of telephone lines.
I counted around thirty the first time we saw the house.
There were so many things to discuss that first visit that I didn't think to ask about them.
I remember thinking to myself: I could do anything with this house,
any kind of business that involved multiple phone lines.
I forgot to ask the Realtor why there were so many phone lines.
There were a million and one other questions our first viewing. 



I called Southwest Bell,
my local telephone company for landlines,
and I requested a phone line.
The person I spoke to assured me that the service person would be out the following day.
However,
they weren't able to narrow it down to less than a four-hour block of time,
which meant that I had to put aside a whole bunch of time to be close to the house when I had other things to do.


The first appointment came and went and no service person showed up at the house.
I was a little irritated but I didn't become angry.
I waited until the end of the work day,
and I called Southwest Bell again,
and I spoke to a different person in the service department.
I explained the situation.
The the customer service representative apologized profusely and assured me that the next available day,
three days further into the week,
a service person would be out to install the landline.


Three days later,
on the appointed day,
in the four-hour block of time,
I patiently waited at the house,
and once again no service person turned up.
This second time I was not so gracious when I called Southwest Bell.
When I got the customer service representative on the phone I said:
Look,
this is getting outrageous.
You have promised me twice now that a service person would come by the house.
In each instance I waited for hours and put away half of my day and no service person came to install my landline.


Once again the customer service representative apologized profusely,
but the second time it wasn't enough for me.
I asked to speak to the manager of the division.
I waited on the phone a couple minutes before I was transferred to another line.
A relatively pleasant female voice picked up the phone and said,
can I help you?


I told my story for the second time.
I had put aside two different half days to wait for a Southwest Bell service person to come by the house and do the most remedial thing that the phone company does,
install a landline,
and twice my installer was a no-show.
The manager of the division asked for my address.
I gave it and then waited.
I could hear activity on the other end of the phone,
her fingers hitting the keyboard,
stop,
fingers hitting the keyboard,
over and over for about five minutes.
I assumed she was reading reports on my address from the database.
I guess the ranch had quite a history with Southwest Bell,
that would explain the thirty landlines coming into the house.


What was different this time was the manager of customer service didn't brush me off or give me a nonsensical excuse.
Her voice changed.
It was kind of an *I'm going to level with you voice*,
not the normal pleasant happy customer service voice with which they had been trained to speak to customers.

She said,
Sir,
the problem is that our installers are subcontractors or independent contractors,
if you will,
and,
as such,
we can't really force them to do anything.
Our work orders come up and they go out over the system and we get confirmations.
If a service rep takes the work order we have no real way to follow-up on whether or not they are committed to going out and fulfilling it.


I thought her explanation was a little ridiculous so I said,
That's no way to run a business.


She agreed,
but added that the business model had never really had problems like this before. 
Their model operated extremely well.
The problem,
she stated,
was my address.
My house had *something of a reputation* and none of the contractors wanted to go out.
They may have just glanced at the work order,
not realizing it was *the house* and accepted the contract to go and install the phone line,
but,
on the contracted day to fulfill the work order,
upon taking out the map book,
looking more closely at the address,
and finally realizing where it was,
they didn't fulfill the order.

I tried to take this all in calmly.
My house had a bad reputation,
so much so Southwest Bell installers didn't want to come over,
but somehow my Realtor didn't know this?
I didn't know this?
What did Southwest Bell installers know that I didn't?


I asked.
What kind of a *reputation*?

Strange,
she confided.
Your house has a strange reputation.

Can you be a little more specific? 
I asked.

They're afraid,
she said.
They're scared to go to your house.

Scared of what? 
I asked.

The reputation, Mr. Edmonds.

Call me old-fashioned, 
but the word reputation for me has always applied to loose women and competent specialists.  
Women got reputations in high school. 
A construction contractor who does home renovations gets a reputation as competent and reliable or untrustworthy.
I had no idea what reputation meant in context to a house. 
The customer service manager assured me that the following week an installer would come by.
She would see to it herself.
I got her name and her word.


In her non-customer service voice,
her *let's be frank with each other* voice,
she told me that the subcontractors were afraid to come out to my house because bad things had happened at the property.
I asked what she meant.
She wouldn't elaborate on what things had happened on my property.
She asked for two hours to sort things out and said she would call me back.
I agreed.

When the two hours came and went,
I called Southwest Bell back.
I tried to get the same woman but nobody had heard of a woman who worked at Southwest Bell by her name.
I literally could not believe what was going on in my life in that first month and a half at the ranch.
Between the lunatic showing up with the machete and all of the contents of the house put into the pool,
this was starting to become annoying.
It was like an inside story everybody knew except me.
It was extremely frustrating.
I did not have the patience or temperament to call Bell Southwest back again that day.
I terminated all contact with the company and decided to just let myself cool down for a few days and try to figure out what was going on.


Lo and behold,
the next day a little white cube van with the logo of a telephone company pulled into my laneway.
Now remember,
the woman I had spoken to *frankly* from Bell Southwest,
the woman nobody knew at the company,
the woman who had not called back in two hours to give me an appointment,
that woman had somehow managed to secure an appointment for me the next day.
I was perplexed and satisfied at the same time.


I watched this little fellow get out of the truck and nervously look around the property.
&mdash;
five feet and six inches,
thick, 
black-rimmed glasses, 
a well manicured mustache, 
a long-sleeved white shirt, 
toolbox in hand
&mdash;
like he was trying to scout for vicious dogs or something.
After fifteen or twenty seconds to satisfy himself that nothing was going to attack him right there in the laneway,
he shuffled up to the doorway.


I went outside and introduced myself as the man who had requested the phone service.
I'll never forget the look on his face.
He looked like he'd just seen a ghost.
He nodded his head and accepted my extended hand.
I turned and he followed me into the house.
He looked all around when we entered the house.
There was a skittishness about him.
I pointed to where I wanted the phone line in the kitchen.
He nodded and opened his toolbox on the kitchen counter.


I felt I should say something,
so I looked at him and said,
I bought this house a couple months ago.
I don't know anything about the property,
its past,
or its reputation.
I understand that there was some concern about coming out here for a service call?


My voice and what I said seemed to calm him.
He looked at me with a more relaxed expression and said,
So you don't know any of the history of this property?


I assured him I did not.
For the next ninety minutes I was given an extraordinary history lesson.
The subcontractor that Southwest Bell had sent was in fact a resident of Buckeye himself and knew Rainbow Valley.
By the time he was done his history lesson I understood the reputation of my house.



##14700 S Tuthill Road




The main house on the ranch was built in 1977.
The land was purchased by a man who quietly built the house himself as a surprise for his wife.
When the house was finished and he brought his wife out to see it,
she took one look at the land and the house and said that she would never live there.
If he forced her to live there she would divorce him.
The man was somewhat devastated because he had worked for some months and spent considerable money on the land and the construction of the ranch,
all in an effort to please his wife.
He didn't understand her response.
Whatever went on in the marriage,
they did end up living on the ranch for a short period of time,
but the woman,
true to her word,
divorced him.


After this unfortunate circumstance,
the property was sold to an off-track betting organization,
which explained all the phone lines in the house.
But that wasn't enough.
They extended their business into prostitution and ran a brothel on the premises as well.
This went on for quite a while,
until the whole thing was shut down and the law in Maricopa County was changed making off-track betting illegal.



The *Sons of Gestapo* are another little mystery from the area.
They are alleged to have derailed the *Sunset Limited* Amtrak train in the middle of the desert,
*alleged* because it was never proven.
Several notes purporting to be from the Sons of Gestapo were found near the crash.
There was a clear anti-government message,
especially toward the FBI and ATF.



At the time nobody had heard of the Sons of Gestapo,
and it would be fair to say that right-wing extremist groups were well monitored by the federal government.
Remember,
this is shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing,
Waco, Texas,
and Ruby Ridge.
Bill Clinton was in the White House and Janet Reno was the Attorney General for the United States.
There was little tolerance for fringe groups of a white Christian variety,
and an atmosphere of domestic terrorism had emerged under Reno.
Crazy crackers with guns and Bibles who wanted to live communally almost immediately qualified for government surveillance. 




The entire affair stinks of some kind of a cover-up,
and many analysts have given their opinion that a right-wing extremist group did not perform this derailment.
It had all the hallmarks of a government job,
a false flag.
As hard as it might be for people to believe,
certain cells of our federal government can do some very bad things to push forward agendas.
It's part of the world we live in.

The only piece of first-hand evidence to be released,
a note purportedly written by the Sons of Gestapo,
was given to an independent researcher named Paul Craig Roberts after he wrote a scathing rebuke of the government's white terrorism hypothesis. 
It reads as follows with no corrections.


>Indictment of the ATF and the FBI

>Before dawn the women awoke to say their morning prayers. The women slept upstairs. They lit their kerosene lamps because the electricity had been turned off by the FBI. After observing lights in all the upstairs windows, the FBI ordered the teargas bombardment. Afterwards only two upstairs windows were lit. The location of each was recorded. Over the next few hours, ventilation holes were poked into the walls. These holes made the fire burn very much faster. Otherwise the fire department would have had time to put out the fire before the women and children died in the flames. At noon the light from the two kerosene lamps was obscured by bright sunlight. Everyone had forgotten about them except the man who carried their locations written on a scrap of paper in his pocket. He ordered the tank drivers where to crash through. Guess under which two windows. He ordered them to raise their guns. As they backed out, the guns were lowered. The video tape shows clearly the floor being raised by the tank a foot and a half. Guess what happened to the kerosene lamps in the rooms above the tanks. A minute afterwards black smoke started to pour out of the windows where the lamps had burned. This is the normal time needed for a kerosene fire to build up.

>Who is policing the ATF, FBI, state troopers, county sheriffs and local police? What federal law enforcement agency investigates each and every choke hold killing committed by a police officer? each and every beating of a drunk whether or not a passerby videotapes it? each and every shooting of a police officer's wife who knows too much about drug kickbacks? each and every killing at Ruby Ridge? The Gestapo accounts to no one. This is not Nazi Germany. All these people had rights. It is time for an independent Federal agency to police the law enforcement agencies and other government employees.



>Sons of the Gestapo

>SOG




The Sons of Gestapo were living at my ranch. 
They were the owners after the off-track betting and brothel operation. 
The Southwest Bell subcontractor told this story with some zeal. 
He was something of an enthusiast. 
The alleged militia, 
which nobody around Buckeye really believed was a militia, 
was pinned in the ranch by a federal assault team that had come to either question or arrest them in the derailment. 
The story goes that the Sons of Gestapo would not be questioned. 
A shootout ensued and several of them were killed. 
More blood on the ranch.


When I was told this story the Internet was not what it is today. 
Several times in the last ten years I've tried to investigate the story more fully, 
but there's precious little information aside from the original press reporting, 
much of which doubts the legitimacy of the militia group. 
There is absolutely no mention of a massacre at my ranch, 
in fact, 
there is absolutely no follow-up to what happened to the Sons of Gestapo.

In the course of writing this book,
Bruce MacDonald called the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department and spoke to the records division.
They told them that they couldn't help him,
but suggested that he call one of the  divisions of the Sheriff's Office,
the one closest to the ranch,
suggesting an older sheriff's deputy might be able to give some information if they had been on the force long enough to remember the shootout.


The day that Bruce called the sheriff's department,
I came home an hour after he had called them.
There were three vehicles from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department on and around my property.
One of them was parked right in my laneway.
All the sheriff's deputies were out taking pictures.
They didn't bother me or ask me any questions when I came home,
however,
the timing of three sheriff's deputies showing up on my property an hour after Bruce MacDonald called the Sheriff's Office to get information about the Sons of Gestapo cannot be ignored.


The most curious thing about the whole derailment and the involvement of the Sons of Gestapo is that the media continues to cover the story.
PBS did a follow-up two years ago on the mystery of the derailment,
which was never solved.
The television show,
*Unsolved Mysteries* with Robert Stack,
did an episode on the derailment and the Sons of Gestapo.
Despite all of this coverage of the derailment,
there is absolutely no follow-up anywhere online or at the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department,
of what happened to the Sons of Gestapo.
That they were living at my ranch is not in question.
I've met countless Buckeye residents who confirmed what the telephone line installer told me.
Yet the media has no account of a shootout at the ranch between the Sons of Gestapo,
the ATF,
the FBI,
and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department,
despite the fact that there are casualties numbering four to six and a complete evacuation of a group of people who had been living a communal lifestyle at the ranch.
Even more curiously,
nowhere in the annals of white supremacy,
including prison culture in America,
is there any real knowledge of the Sons of Gestapo.
The Ku Klux Klan know nothing about them.
The Aryan Brotherhood knows nothing about them.
Nobody has ever heard of them.
And just like that,
they disappeared off the face of the earth after they were smeared with responsibility for the derailment absent any conclusion to the investigation by the local,
state,
or federal authorities.




After the alleged Sons of Gestapo massacre,
a Mexican family bought the ranch.
The telephone installer didn't have all the details on how many people were in the family.
They started a cattle operation and ran it successfully for a few years.
They specialized in veal.
On the day of the high school graduation for their son,
he put a shotgun in his mouth and blew his head off.
More blood on the ranch.
As I listened to the Southwest Bell installer,
I started to imagine that the earth itself on the ranch preferred blood to water.


When he was done his long yarn,
I looked at him and said,
What can I do?

He looked back at me and said,
I would cancel the sale and sue the Realtor and get my money back.

I told him I paid cash and that wasn't going to happen.
He looked away and had nothing more to say to me.
