Engagement
===============



Men have been biologically hardwired to defend a home since the beginning of time.
In most instances the defenses are against an encroaching army or some form of invader force from another country or region or tribe;
the variation in my story is that the encroachment was from some other dimension or world or solar system,
a strange mix of the paranormal and the extraterrestrial.
The things moving around the house were definitely what most people would associate with paranormal activity,
a poltergeist,
or something in that class of being.
What was done to my Rottweiler,
Gunner,
was more in line with the extraterrestrial phenomenon,
as my research had told me.


By this time in my story,
Joyce and I had been on the ranch about seven years.
I would like to say that we had acclimatized to the phenomenon going on around us,
but that would be a bit of an exaggeration.
Most of the time,
we tried to pretend it wasn't happening until it got really out of hand.
I continued to see the lights in the sky when I drove out into the desert in the Jeep.
Things continued to disappear around the house.


A new twist emerged.
Sometimes I would misplace my car keys or my wedding ring,
and,
while I would be walking through the house looking for the misplaced item,
it would drop out of the air above me and fall on my head,
then slide down my back or front and land on the floor in front of or behind me.
Something was taking the things.
Something in the house could make physical items disappear and materialize at a different time.
Whatever was there didn't want us there.
The history of the house and the bizarre reputation it had garnered among the locals,
and especially among the phone installers,
now made complete sense to me.
I would not have wanted to come out to the ranch and install phone lines if I worked for the phone company.




What concerned me most at that time were the nocturnal activities,
the scars,
bruising,
indentations,
and branding that would appear on our bodies in the morning,
not always,
but always present and always recurring right around the time we would forget about it,
there to remind us in the mornings when we woke up that we were living with something extremely negative and supernatural.




I became increasingly militant.
I kept guns at different locations throughout the house.
I had to be careful.
There was a lot of brick in the interior and for those of you who are familiar with firearms,
you know that brick is a difficult wall surface.
Bullets tend to ricochet off brick and you could end up shooting yourself or somebody you didn't intend to shoot.





Joyce didn't question what I was doing.
She understood completely.
I was just being the man of the house.
We were dealing with a violent presence that meant us harm.
It was natural in her mind for the man of the house to go out and get arms.
It was no time for any debate on firearms in the house.
We were both way past that.
There were knives and baseball bats and pipes in various parts of the house.
Preeminent in my mind was what was done to my animals,
the flattened Rottweiler and the eviscerated horses. 


Another aspect of what we were going through was the extreme isolation.
Things that are not of this world tend to isolate people.
If you have problems with mounting debt due to a gambling problem,
at some point you're just going to break down and call your brother or your brother-in-law or your parents,
if they're still alive,
come clean,
promise to join Gamblers Anonymous,
and look for a solution to the problem.
Same thing with drinking,
although with drinking or drugs it's usually the significant other that reaches out for help and forms an intervention.
As you go down the list of problems that human beings face,
there's a solution to almost everything.
All of those rules go out the window when you're dealing with something not of this world.
You can't call up family and explain what was going on at our ranch.
Most of my family was dead by the time I bought the ranch anyways.
A series of illnesses and accidents wiped out almost all of my family in the early nineties.
Joyce's family lived in Wisconsin,
and they were strict Catholics.
We were not going to bother them with this stuff.
They probably wouldn't believe us anyways.
Then you go through your list of friends.
There are people that you kept in contact with from high school,
maybe University,
and your work friends and colleagues,
social couples that you've met through your wife,
things like this,
and when you get to the end of this list you realize there's no one that you would call up and say hey can we go and have a coffee?
I have some things to discuss with you.
I don't know what it is about this material that isolates you so much.
There's a tremendous fear in all of us about talking about things which are not part of the general consensus of accepted phenomenon in this human existence.
All of us deep down are very worried about being called crazy,
even if we know we're telling the truth,
even if we have support in the form of a husband or wife,
as was the case with Joyce and I,
even with all of that you don't want to go out into the public and talk about these things.

Human beings are social animals,
and most of our problems are solved in the circles we socialize,
family and friends.
Now there are definitely things that people keep to themselves but still seek help with outside of social circles.
I bare witness to this.
I was a social work counselor for years.
I did my graduate work at Arizona State.
I worked in institutions for years.
I ran a private practice.
I am well familiar with all of the things that people go and see a therapist for that they would not share with their family or friends.
Everybody needs somewhere to go to let something out of them that's eating them alive.
Everyone needs to check their sanity from time to time and speak to a professional.
No harm no foul,
and certainly no shame.
For some people the therapist is substituted with a priest or rabbi,
but it's the same net effect.
You have someone to go and talk to about a deeply personal problem.
The extremely crippling and debilitating thing about what was going on at the ranch was how much it isolated Joyce and I.
We only had each other,
and a lot of the time we were at each other's throats and fighting.
On top of this,
we are going through this living hell at the ranch.


With each passing month,
and with the passing of the first year,
and well into our second year at the ranch,
it was as though whatever was there was becoming more and more belligerent,
more daring in revealing itself.
I sometimes thought that this was because it realized we were isolated.
The stuff in the first year that has already been described in this book seems to me to have been designed to get us to leave the ranch.
It had already crossed my mind,
at this point in my sojourn at the ranch,
that the poor seventeen-year-old Mexican boy was taken out,
driven to suicide by the dark forces that had been working on my mind,
an adult mind with psychiatric training,
and even I was almost brought to my wit's end.
I could only imagine what that poor boy went through.




So when assuming the role of the protector,
I not only had to arm myself and be prepared for anything in the house,
I also had to figure out what was going on.
This took me into deep research about the history of the area and the phenomenon we were dealing with at the ranch.
This is how I came into contact with all the other researchers,
like Linda Moulton Howe.
In the literature I came across,
including the Walton abduction close to the ranch in 1976,
perhaps one of the most famous abduction stories of all time,
there had never been any stories about human beings killed.
The mutilations were usually livestock.
They never took place too close to a ranch,
but rather in the fields,
when the animals were alone at night.
Like my story there was never any warning,
any cry of pain,
or any distress at night that disturbed the animal population.
If you keep dogs at a farm,
you know they are extremely sensitive to everything going on around,
and their chief utility is to act as an alarm system.
In all of the animal mutilation stories I have come across,
as I began to pour through the literature,
there was never any warning given to the people.
It was the same story over and over again.
They would wake up in the morning,
go out to do their chores and,
in the process of checking on the livestock,
they would find an animal mutilated.
They were not always mutilated the same way.
Sometimes the sexual organs were taken.
Other times the anus was bored out.
In some instances,
the animals were completely eviscerated.
I didn't come across too many stories that resembled what happened to my Rottweiler,
which was completely unbelievable.
But all of the mutilations had this one thing in common:
they could not have been done by any kind of livestock vandals or livestock looters.
The history of the desecration of the animals bodies was beyond even the medical practices of most hospitals.
The idea of people with that kind of medical expertise sneaking around the entire country of the United States and doing this to animals was preposterous,
and,
of course,
I must add here that the animal mutilation phenomenon was international.






Because the markings on our bodies happened at night,
I became especially defensive about the bedroom.
We were being attacked where we slept.
Neither Joyce nor I had awoken during any of these assaults.
I placed a baseball bat behind the headboard of the bed in our master bedroom.
I didn't keep a gun close to the the bed,
nor a knife.
I didn't want to wake up half asleep and do something stupid.
So a baseball bat seemed like the best form of defense in the bedroom.




I finally had an experience with the night time visitors.
It was in the middle of the night.
At the location of our ranch in Rainbow Valley,
there wasn't a sound to be heard in the middle of the night.
Back then,
there weren't enough houses around for traffic much past 11:00 PM.
Whatever was visiting us in the middle of the night,
leaving marks and brands and indents on Joyce and I,
made little or no sound,
at least nothing that either one of us had heard up until that point,
and certainly not enough to wake us up.


On the night of my first engagement with them,
it was not a sound that brought me out of my sleep.
It was touch.
I had been lying in the bed for about ninety minutes with my eyes closed,
unable to fall asleep.
in some kind of dreamscape,
in and out of consciousness,
and I felt a cold and clammy *thing* touch my arm around the wrist and stroke my forearm along the inside right up to the elbow. 
I immediately sprang into action.
I grabbed the baseball bat from behind the headboard,
and I swung as hard as I could right in front of me on my side of the bed.
I heard a hiss.
It's a little hard to describe.
The closest thing I can compare it to is if you were to take a knife and puncture a soccer ball or football.
It was that sound of the sudden evacuation of air under pressure.
I flipped on the night light and there they were
&mdash;
three of the gray aliens right inside the bedroom on my side of the bed.
They stood about four feet tall.
They had no genitalia.
Their arms and legs were very thin.
They were a little thicker up in the chest area,
and their wastes were uncommonly thin.
They had large,
globe-like heads with bulbous black eyes.
The eyes were what haunted me the most,
like insect eyes,
giant fly eyes.
Before I could get another hit in with the baseball bat,
they literally phased out.
Now I know I sound crazy,
but believe me when I tell you,
Joyce has seen this over the years.
People who have stayed at the ranch have seen this.
They literally phase out as though they're behind an invisible stage curtain.

And that was my first encounter with *the grays*.


##Phoenix Lights

In each instance,
each escalation of supernatural occurrence,
our minds denied what was happening.
Even after the doppelgangers,
the mutilated animals,
and lights in the sky,
I fought the idea in my own mind that I brained an alien with a baseball bat.
This is what trauma does.
It effects our thinking.
We try to change our reality.
We let that old comfortable voice come back and raise doubt
&mdash;
Did that really happen?
Maybe I dreamed it?
My mind was no different.
Nor is the public mind.
This might be part of the reason we lie to ourselves in general.

In 1997 Phoenix experienced what has famously come to be known as the *Phoenix Lights*.
Thousands of people saw the lights.
In typical form,
the media and government gave a  horseshit cover-up story
&mdash;
the lights were flares dropped from a high flying bomber over the Barry Goldwater Air Range.





KTAR News recently did a memorial story on MARCH 13, 2019. The headline read:

>More than 20 years later, mystery of Phoenix Lights still fascinates people



I don't know if it's the government's desire to appear ironic,
but Goldwater himself was one of the strongest proponents of full government disclosure on Arizona's extraterrestrial and UFO phenomenon.
That his name would be used in a cover-up posthumously must cause him some humor wherever he is now.



>PHOENIX — Wednesday marks the 22nd anniversary of one of the strangest things to ever happen in Arizona, the Phoenix Lights phenomenon.

>Those who witnessed the bizarre lights described them as “otherworldly” and the phenomena is remembered fondly each year since it — whatever it was — was spotted.

>According to the Mutual UFO Network, on March 13, 1997 between 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., thousands of people reported seeing strange, bright lights flying over Nevada, Arizona and part of Mexico.

>“It wasn’t just one event, there were many events across the state for more than 12 hours,” Phoenix Lights Network spokeswoman Lynne Kitei said.

>The first event was described as a V-shaped object the size of a commercial plane soaring through the sky.

Eyewitness reports thoroughly debunk the government's flare cover story.

>One witness from Prescott who wished to be known only as J.R. said he watched a boomerang-shaped object glide over Granite Mountain, and it was at least a mile wide. He said there’s no way it was from this planet.

>“We don’t have anything that big,” he said. “It was totally silent. I’ve never seen anything even close to the colors from the exhaust that propelled that thing. It was as big as downtown Prescott and completely blocked out the stars.”

Another witness was a police officer.

>The second event was reported by an unidentified former Arizona police officer who claimed he saw a series of stationary, orange and red lights hanging over the Valley.


The Governor hit a new high note for government mockery.


>The Phoenix Lights were treated as a joke at first by then-Gov. Fife Symington, who had an aide dress as an alien for a press conference about the phenomenon.

>“This just goes to show that you guys are entirely too serious,” Symington said then.

>However, Symington later did a complete 180 and not only said he saw the lights himself, but believed them to be of otherworldly origin.

>“I’m a pilot, and I know just about every machine that flies,” Symington said. “It was bigger than anything that I’ve ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don’t know why people would ridicule it.”


There was no denying it,
though,
I was living in a UFO state,
and my ranch was a place of high activity.

What worried me about the grays in the bedroom,
who clearly where the parties responsible for leaving the marks on my body and Joyce's body,
was the specter of abduction.
This marked a new field of inquiry and research for me.
I dove in to it head first.
Of course,
there had already been movies made about this phenomenon,
and there was all kinds of literature out there,
but reading about it and experiencing it are two completely different things.
I now had to contend with the idea that I was being abducted,
and that my wife was being abducted.
Much of the literature speaks about not remembering abductions.
It became painfully clear to me that the marks on our bodies were the result of things done to us when we were abducted.
And as I said,
there was nobody to talk to about this.
It left me very alone.
I felt impotent,
powerless,
and vulnerable.
Maybe that's why I was overcompensating with all the weapons.
All of the weapons on earth are designed to kill human beings.
I wasn't even sure at that point whether these creatures could be killed.
I brained one with a baseball bat and all it did was hiss.
It didn't matter,
though.
I didn't have any other options.
I would fight this fight the only way I knew how to fight.
Even if it was completely futile.
I cannot begin to express to you the sense of violation.
It felt like getting raped.
