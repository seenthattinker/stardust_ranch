Disquiet 
========= 



Somewhere around the sixty or ninety day mark in the home I became aware of a disquieting presence.
I didn't know what it was at first.
It affected my mood.
I would find myself very angry all the time.
I didn't express it around Joyce.
I carried it around inside of me.
I didn't know what it was.
I started to feel the way I had felt when I grew up in Evanston.
I was raised in a very rough part of Illinois by parents who did not have a lot of money.
I learned to be hyper-vigilant.
That's how you survive where I was raised.
You could not take your eye off the game for a second.
Walking down the sidewalk you had to be aware of the people loitering a hundred yards ahead of you.
Eye contact or lack thereof was important.
When you're a teenage kid walking around in my neighborhood eye contact for too long is a sign of aggression.
But at the same time your eyes had to be working.
This constant state of vigilance is what I noticed in myself when I was home alone on the ranch,
especially when I was inside the house.
It could go away for hours when I was doing chores or going into town,
going to the feed store,
the hardware store,
stopping in for a coffee at the local coffee shop,
chatting with locals in Buckeye,
traveling around in the truck with a pair of the Rottweilers.
All of these activities could abate that sense of vigilance.
But the moment I got home,
and I was alone in that house,
it would return in very short time.
There was a short grace I would have where the energy of my activity outside the house would still be in my mind,
and I would be reminiscing about what I did,
chuckling about little jokes I heard,
and musing about conversations I had with people I'd bumped into during the day.
But after that grace was gone,
and my mind realized that I was alone in that house,
the negativity would come on me again.


Because I was a trained counselor,
I set up mental exercises to try to dismiss the tension.
I tried to rationalize it.
I would say to myself:
John,
why are you allowing yourself to feel tense?
There's nothing to feel tense about here.
I could manage it in some small measure,
but,
just like keeping your eyes open and peeled in the neighborhood in which I grew up,
there was an equivalent form of psychological vigilance that I had to maintain to cope with being in the home.
As you can well imagine,
having put the majority of my life savings into the ranch,
I was not enjoying it the way I thought I was going to enjoy it.
Aside from the several small things already documented in this story,
like the strange man with the machete who said he killed monsters,
the inexplicable presence of all the contents of the house in the pool,
and the lights I would see in the sky,
both at night from the home,
and during the day when I was out in the Jeep with the dogs,
everything else was fairly normal,
or lacking any phenomenon to suggest it was anything but normal.
This left me to believe that everything that was going on was just in my head.
Why would I believe anything else?

My mental discipline and psychological training aided me quite a bit in staying out of negative moods.
But then something else started to happen.
Small inconveniences would creep up all the time.
I would go to use a tool and the electricity wouldn't work.
There was no rational reason for why the electricity would not work.
When I checked the fuses and the tool I was using,
whether it was a skill saw or a drill,
they were always in proper working condition,
as was the electricity on the ranch.
Often the situations would repair themselves without any tinkering on my part.
It was almost as though some gremlin was at work.

Another thing that started to happen was that I misplaced a lot of things.
I would lay my cell phone down,
and,
when I went to retrieve it a couple hours later, 
it would not be where I thought I had left it.
Same thing with the car keys.
Same thing with bills that had to be paid that I left on the kitchen table.
This got to be such a phenomenon,
that I thought I might be moving into early Alzheimer's.
I mentioned it to Joyce and she said that she saw no evidence of it whatsoever.
She,
by the way,
maintained her initial intuitive response to the ranch throughout this time,
which was entirely negative.
She wanted to leave.
Let me be completely clear about that.



The phenomenon of the misplaced items became even more curious when they would reappear sometime later in exactly the same spot that I believed I 
originally left them and had already looked.
So imagine you come home from ninety minutes of chores in town,
you unload the truck of salt bags for the horses and other treats for the dogs and all the things that you bought in town,
you do a quick walk around the property to make sure everything is okay,
check on all the animals,
go into the house,
already having experienced the phenomenon of disappearing items,
so you very consciously place your keys in a very specific spot,
and then you go take a shower.
Upon coming out of the bathroom some thirty minutes later,
after shaving,
washing my hair,
and doing all of my grooming,
I would return to the exact spot I consciously laid the keys,
in full knowledge of the fact that I was misplacing a lot of things,
and the keys would not be there.

At the risk of sounding paranoid,
it was almost as though something was working against my psychological training and mental discipline to not go into negative spaces in my own mind.
It was difficult.
Try to put yourself in my position.
You've already got this invisible disquiet that seems to be coming into your mind when you're alone in the house.
You deal with that with a focused psychological treatment of yourself,
and then the physical phenomenon of disappearing items to cause frustration begins recurring in your life.
I started to get angry again.
To be completely honest with you,
I would sometimes have temper tantrums alone in the house
&mdash;
throw things around,
kick things,
punch the walls
&mdash;
always careful never to destroy anything.
I didn't want Joyce to know that I was in a negative state of mind when I was home alone at the ranch,
because then the inevitable conversation of why we were even staying at the ranch would commence.

I was the stalwart.
I was the one who wanted to stay at the ranch,
not Joyce,
so I had to hold the line in this regard.
It was incredibly difficult to maintain my mood and to stave off anger when there was already this invisible disquiet,
this festering negativity in the house,
almost like an odorless odor.
There was almost a tangibility to it
&mdash;
couple this with the disappearing items and it became very difficult for me to maintain my composure.


When things started disappearing,
I realized that I had to be more scientific about what was going on in the house when I was alone.
I began to extract myself from the idea that this was all in my head,
and I did what all rational people do
&mdash;
I documented.
I began to notice that there was phenomenon associated with the sense of disquiet I had.
The only thing I can compare it to is a change of pressure in the room.
You might have experienced something like this in anticipation of a thunderstorm,
or some similar climate related event,
but I assure you it was physical.
There was a distinct change of pressure in the room.
Sometimes it would seem to get colder.
These physical anomalies became my first documented symptoms of the disquieting presence in the house.
Once I documented a change in the pressure and temperature in the room,
I cast my gaze further afield.
I noticed that before these events,
these disquieting presences,
there would be disruption and aberrant behavior among the animals.
The horses would become agitated.
The dogs would sometimes start fighting among themselves.
Everything around me indicated that something preternatural was coming into my space,
and all of this began with bad moods that I thought were just regrets about buying the ranch.
As I was figuring all of this out,
I did it the hard way.
It wasn't until some months living at the ranch that I figured out that something was coming and going,
something preternatural.
Once I figured this out,
it's almost as though whatever was there decided to express itself more freely given that I had accepted that it was there.
It was like communication between us.
It didn't reveal itself fully beyond just the pressure change and the behavior of the animals until I fully acknowledged in my own mind that it was real and it was not my imagination.
From that point on,
any time I would get angry,
anytime I would let my emotions run away in a negative way,
the environment would speak back to me in a paranormal way.
Things would move around in the kitchen.
Plates would fall off the counter and hit the floor.
The refrigerator would rock back and forth,
things like this,
right on the periphery of paranormal and explainable,
as though the entire drama was meant to drive me insane.
From there it moved into the electronics.
The television would come on by itself and go to its maximum volume.
The stereo would turn on in the middle of the night.
As time went on,
both Joyce and I were acutely aware that there was something in the house.
Because Joyce spent less time in the house than I did
&mdash;
she had a night job on top of her FBI office job that kept her away from the house from early in the morning till quite late at night
&mdash;
she was only at the house at night,
and completely unaware of what I was dealing with.
I tried to downplay the things like the TV and the stereo going on.
I really didn't want to start to hear things like *I told you so*,
and *we never should have bought this place*.
I wanted to keep her shielded from what was going on.
I wanted to keep it secret.
In my own engagement with the negative forces at the ranch,
I had been heartened by the changing pressure and the mood in the animals.
These were points of reference for me to assure myself that I was not going crazy.
The things that were happening were real.
It was strange,
but it could be explained or rationalized.

##Dead Dog

The situation reached a pitch when I lost my favorite dog.
We kept the dogs outside in dog crates in a large structure that was like a kennel.
I spent time with the dogs everyday as I've already described.
I can't remember when exactly I became so attached to the Rottweiler breed.
It happened sometime in Glendale, Arizona.
There really wasn't the space or climate to keep dogs like that in such numbers in Evanston.
I've always had a very special relationship with animals.
I've always felt really good with them around me,
and I've always had one kind of a pet or another no matter where I lived.
Later on we got a parrot at the house.


With Joyce having to be out of the house at a fairly early hour every day,
the first thing I took care of every morning was her breakfast and coffee and we spent some time together before she left the house.
It was after this that I would go and tend to the animals.
First came the dogs,
who I fed and watered and gave a little recreational time to,
then came the horses,
same thing,
feeding and watering.
On this particular day,
as I watched Joyce drive off,
I turned around to go out to the kennels and everything felt okay.
I went out the back door and walked toward the Rottweilers,
and even from some twenty-five yards away I could see that something was wrong.


One of the dog crates had been opened.
I began to scan the terrain.
Not too far from the dog crate,
I saw what were the remains of my favorite Rottweiler.
It was the first animal mutilation that I experienced on the property,
and it was also the first experience with something that would come to represent the oppressive feeling and change of pressure that I had felt in the 
house.
It had acted.
I knew the moment I saw the dead dog it was the force in the house that was responsible.
It wasn't my imagination,
nor was I developing Alzheimer's and misplacing things constantly,
nor were there any electrical problems in the house that would turn on the stereo or TV in the middle of the night.
Now I knew all of these things were not accidents to begin with.
It was all real,
and it was becoming more aggressive.
It seemed to be synced to my understanding of it,
like it knew I was aware of it,
beginning with the atmosphere changes when it showed up.


What was particularly disconcerting about the animal's death was the manner in which it had been killed.
The carcass was completely flat,
no thicker than a manhole cover.
It was as though it had been run over by a steamroller.
But there were no innards,
no blood,
no gore scattered about.
It wasn't possible.
There was also the crate to consider,
something had to take the dog out of the crate.
If you know anything about Rottweilers,
the first thing you might be asking yourself right now is why didn't we hear anything in the middle of the night?
There are eight dogs.
One of them,
my favorite,
was taken out of his crate,
desecrated and mutilated.
I didn't hear any sound associated with the panic of the dog being killed,
nor did I hear any barking from the seven companion dogs,
who would have been in a state of extreme agitation knowing that one of their pack was being attacked and killed.
My first emotional response was pure rage.
I stomped around for some fifteen or twenty minutes just cursing and kicking the ground and yelling at the top of my lungs.
Whatever did this had my full attention.
The day that line was crossed,
the day that my favorite dog was killed,
was the day that I declared war on whatever was assaulting me in the ranch.

The death of the dog also marked the time for me to give full disclosure to Joyce.
I couldn't live with this any longer,
and I couldn't protect her from it any longer.
The only sensible thing to do at that point was to tell her everything that had been going on,
all of the things that I intuited,
all of the little mood shifts during the day,
the pressure and climate changes inside the house that came about suddenly,
and all the bizarre little things that happened during the day when she was not there,
like things cluttering around in the kitchen when nobody was there.
With the death of the dog,
Joyce and I had to accept the fact that we were living in a place that had phenomenon going on we knew absolutely nothing about.


When she got home that night,
I took her outside with a flashlight and showed her the dead dog.

She was quiet for quite some time,
a look of complete bewilderment on her face.

What could even do that? She said.

I have no idea, I answered.
