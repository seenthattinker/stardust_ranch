Afterword 
=========

My name is Joyce Edmonds. I've been around for this whole story. It's true that I did not want to move to Stardust Ranch in 1996. I 
had a bad feeling about the place from the moment that I saw it. We were the only ones in Rainbow Valley in 1996. The place felt very creepy to me. I did 
not like being at the ranch alone. In the early years I did not know how to explain what I felt. I think sometimes it came across to my husband, John, as 
perhaps just a woman's issue. I didn't want to go outside the ranch at night.

When things started happening at the ranch I was in denial for a long time. Most of the weird and violent stuff happened to John first. My coping mechanism was to deny it was happening. Over time I realized that I was just using 
John for my own denial. It became clear to me that the things happening at night were happening to both of us. It's hard to give a word to how I felt 
about this. I could say horror, but it doesn't quite capture everything. There really is no word. I guess I will have to stay with horror. My earliest 
understanding that something was not right had to do with waking up in the morning and having marks on my body. My earliest encounters with whatever we 
have in the house were not visual. For me it started by hearing things. The things made certain noises. The grays make a hissing sound. I would also hear 
things moving around at night. I can remember very clearly the exact incident that took all of my denial away. John and I woke up in the morning and both 
of us were extremely raw and chafed on the inside of our thighs. We figured out that we had been abducted. It was horrifying for me. After that things 
proceeded to the point where I was being taken multiple times. I don’t really have a full recollection of it. However, I was waking up at different times 
in the middle of the night. It was usually between two and three-thirty in the morning. I would hear a lot of things, and sometimes when I woke up the 
whole bedroom was lit up. It was always a machine sound. I can't quite describe it. It wasn't mechanical like a factory sound. Machine sound is the best 
that I can do. The night time disturbances began to seriously affect my ability to work and cope because I was sleep deprived.

One of the hardest things about all of this for me has been the isolation from my family. I've made new friends who I can speak about the situation with. I was never able to get 
any support from my family. I come from a strongly Catholic Family in Wisconsin. When I confided with one of my sisters about what was going on at the 
ranch, it came back to me that my family wanted me to come home to Wisconsin and spend some time in a state mental hospital.
It got so bad that some days I would book off work without telling John and go to my boss’s house and sleep during the day. My boss knew what was going on. I started to get anxiety 
attacks. These are not pleasant.

You're just sort of gripped by an unseen negative force that collapses your world into a moment of complete and total 
panic. Everything that was going on at the ranch was wearing me down. It was like something was working on me, trying to reduce all of my defenses as a 
human being, and the sleep deprivation was a big part of it. That's pretty much how the first fifteen years went for me at the ranch.

I don't have the recall that John has. My memory doesn't have the interactions with the grays. I only have the effects upon my body and my mind. That's not true for July 
31st, 2011. That remains one of the most fascinating days of my life. I had been told by John that some people were coming out to the ranch, but I wasn't 
given a whole lot of detail.

You have to understand, I really stayed out of what was going on at the ranch, and this includes the investigations, the 
fascination, the whole celebrity of the ranch was something I kept myself completely separated from. The ranch was just a toxic place for me.

On the day that Brandy and her two Sirians came, I was a little bit late. I was at the gym and I’d forgotten about the appointment. John called me on my cell 
phone and told me to get home as quickly as I could. I packed up my things and went home from the gym. When I got into the house, Brandy was at the table 
and there was something going on there that to this day I have difficulty describing. It was a ball of light that she had somehow created and while we 
were sitting in the kitchen different people began to appear in the room. I mean one moment somebody would not be there and the next moment they were 
there. It was as mysterious as what had been happening for the last fifteen years with the negative extraterrestrials, but this experience had a much more 
positive feel to it. I missed the part where Brandy released the teenage boy who committed suicide in the house. John told me that the walls heated up so 
much he thought the house was going to catch fire. I was given a piece of crystal to hold. Everybody was holding crystal. We went around the whole house 
and did prayers with Brandy, and we petitioned the negative forces to leave the house. All of this was pretty uneventful. It didn't get really crazy until 
we went outside.

Outside, Brandy and her two Sirians stood close together, and I was told to keep holding onto my crystal, so I did. John was beside me. 
Brandy and the two Sirians were saying prayers, at least I assume they were prayers. They were speaking in an incantational way. Brandy brought out a 
sword, and she held it up to the sky and kept praying. All of a sudden, a bunch of clouds rolled in. It was not unnatural. I had been living on that ranch 
for a decade-and-a-half, and I had never seen anything like it. I felt like I was in the movie *Bewitched*. Clouds rolled in all around us over the ranch, 
and it got very dark very quickly. Then the clouds opened up and I saw a spaceship come from behind them. I looked at John, and I said, Are you seeing 
what I'm seeing? 

He said, Yes, it's a ship. 

People were driving by and stopping. Neighbors were coming out of their houses. This event was not just seen 
by John and I and Brandy and her cohorts, it was seen by many others. It was so bizarre to see my neighbors out pointing up in the air. Brandy and the 
Sirians had all these orbs around them, and they continued to pray. I wasn't the least bit scared. It was all very calming. I knew that it was being done 
to protect us. It was like a movie. It was really unbelievable. It remains the most remarkable day of my life. I felt really good because everything that 
had been going on the ranch had been very personal for John and I, and, like I said, there was nobody to really share it with. When this ship showed up 
and everybody could see it, including my neighbors, I felt vindicated somehow. I felt like everything I had been bottling up inside me could be let go 
because all of it was real. You have to understand, there's a part of every human being that keeps telling us we're crazy when things happen that are 
outside our minds ability to comprehend, process, and digest.

I had never seen a spaceship like that before. Brandy said that this was our ship, meaning John and I, and that it was going to protect us. The clouds became dark and the wind picked up and suddenly we were in some kind of a storm. I could see 
electricity in the sky. I don't mean to keep repeating myself, but it was really amazing. A bolt of purple lightning came out of the dark clouds and 
struck the ground just a few feet away from Brandy. I guess it traveled under the ground and came up through her shoes, because the soles of her shoes 
were blown off. She didn't show any signs of distress, so I wasn't worried about her at the time. I tried to see her a week later at a shop she ran near 
Phoenix. She sold crystals and other stuff and did readings for people. It was really odd, though, because after what had happened at the ranch the week 
before, she acted like she didn't recognize me. I didn't realize then what was going on with her. I didn't understand the profound effect the lightning 
strike had upon her. She had no memory of me. She had no memory of the visit to the ranch. She was a different person. It took Brandy years to get her 
memory back. We didn't reconnect with her for a number of years after that visit to the ranch. She reached out to us as a result of hearing us, or rather 
my husband, on a late night radio program, talking about the phenomenon at the ranch. It was then that we learned that she underwent a number of 
operations as a result of the lightning strike, and that a chunk of her memory had been erased.

The only thing she said to me that day I visited her at her shop was that I needed to contact my mother. My mother missed me, and that she wanted to hear from me. She said that to me without even realizing who I was, without knowing that I was the person at the ranch a week earlier.

I called my mother, and, in fact, it was true, she needed to hear from me. When we finally did connect with Brandy years later, she was a completely different person. When she came out to the ranch on July 31st 2011, she was a very 
meticulous and precise person. She was completely in control of everything that was going on. She was like a general in an army. There wasn't much levity 
or comedy in her personality. When we reconnected she was much lighter and easygoing, and she joked around all the time. The lightning strike completely 
changed her personality.

The number of people who were outside the house on that day, July 31st, 2011, was more than the number of people who had come with Brandy in the car. When the incident was over, people literally just disappeared. I didn't know at the time that these were extraterrestrials. I can 
tell you that they looked exactly like us. They looked like human beings.

There was a little bit of an edge to them. They look to be super healthy and every aspect of their physical being was what I would call perfect,

their hair, their skin, their teeth, everything. But the moment Brandy was done they just disappeared. One moment they were there, and the next moment they were gone.

I could tell stories almost forever about the things that have happened on this ranch. The encounter with Brandy, the spaceship, and the lightning bolt is hands-down the most amazing thing that's happened, but there are a lot 
of close seconds. One that comes to mind took place a number of years ago. John and I were in the living room watching television. There was a rainstorm 
outside. We lost all power in the house and everything went dark and the television went off. Then the back hallway towards the bedrooms completely lit 
up. I told john that I wanted to go see what it was. He wouldn't let me. He was convinced I would be abducted. So we stayed in the living room, and we 
looked down the hallway, which remained lit up with this white light. And then to our astonishment, two Roman Centurions from what I assume is at least a 
couple thousand years ago marched right down the hallway and through the living room and out the wall. I could never make up a story like this.

It really happened. There's so many of these stories that I don't even know where to begin or end. It's just been my life for the last two-and-a-half decades.
Throughout all of this, John and I have grown closer. Our bond has grown stronger. When I look back at the two and a half decades on this ranch,

I can't imagine any other life now. It has been hard, and it has been very stressful and frightening at times, but I have seen a world that very few people see. 
It can't be unseen. My reality is completely different than the average person's as a result of living on this ranch. It's hard not to see some sense of 
predestination in a situation like this. I guess I just believe at this point that I was supposed to live on this ranch with my husband, John. I don't 
like to get involved in the public messaging too much. I feel this is just something I was meant to experience as an individual. I certainly understand 
the concept of making the information public, but I just don't feel that's my mission the way my husband does.

Everything that has been told in this story is true. Robert Bigelow has made numerous offers to buy our ranch. People from the government have been here to do tests. In 2017 our story blew up and became a national story, the result of a Realtor creating a press release that got picked up by every major newspaper and news outlet in the country. I guess this gave me some kind of vindication with my family, who had not given up the idea that I was going crazy. One of the hardest things about going 
through something like I have gone through is that in being exposed to so much that is paranormal, it makes it more difficult for you to fit into the 
normal world. Even with that said, I wouldn't change what has happened. I feel privileged to have experienced what I've experienced on this ranch and to 
see a perspective on life that very few people get to see. I'm not sure I want to retire and live out my years on this ranch, but it has been a very 
engaging time. I guess what's changed most is my understanding of God and creation, and the realization that human beings are just one of a number of 
races that were created by some creator. We live in different parts of this universe and other universes and sometimes they overlap each other. It's all 
contributed to a deeper sense of wonder I have about life, and it hasn't diminished my faith in the creator at all. It’s increased it.
