Breaking The Fourth Wall
===============================

Theater and film have the concept of the fourth wall.
If you look at the structure of an outdoor amphitheater that the Greeks used to perform in,
its shape represented three walls.
This was for acoustics.
The actors' voices would pitch out into the stands.
It was also to represent the reality space for the actors.
If you've ever been to a modern theater production,
there's a left wall,
a right wall,
and a back wall,
the same basic structure of the amphitheater,
the place for viewing.
The fourth wall is the audience.
The actors on the stage pretend the audience is not there.
This is the strength of the drama.
It takes place enclosed within its own reality and is watched live by an audience.



Breaking the fourth wall occurs when a actor on the stage or in a film directly addresses the audience.
An example of this would be the film *Ferris Buellerâ€™s Day Off*.
The central character addresses the audience directly numerous times throughout the film.
Another example would be Woody Allen directly addressing the audience in *Annie Hall.*



I need to break the fourth wall as a writer.
I,
Bruce MacDonald,
need to speak directly to you the reader to help you understand the story John and I are trying to tell.
It needs to be stated that John's memory is not one hundred percent as far as the timeline goes.
John and his wife Joyce have endured a superhuman level of stress,
trauma,
and terror.
John is an unusual human being in his capacity to take abuse and keep going,
perhaps some kind of flicker in his fight or flight response.
The most difficult topic to broach while working on this book with John was the topic of abductions.
We've already spoken about the blue-white beam coming from the saucer and Joyce levitating through the house to be taken on an abduction and John firing an AK-47 into the craft,
but we have not spoken about of the abductions that were successful. 





John and his wife underwent numerous abductions.
Through regression hypnotherapy John recalled eighteen abductions.
These regressions were done by a medical doctor who worked with the Department of Defense in Washington,
specializing in post-traumatic stress disorder for combat veterans.
The government is a part of John's story.
They know he exists.
They know what's going on with his ranch.
His story has been verified as authentic six ways to Sunday.
It would stand the scrutiny of any grand jury or any inquisition brought into force to prove or disprove the veracity of his claims.



A number of people that stayed at the ranch experienced phenomenon.
Many of them attest to the phenomenon that goes on at the ranch.
The popular television series,
*Ghost Adventures*,
did an episode at the ranch,
episode twelve of season twelve,
the only extraterrestrial story they have done.
Many psychics have gone out to visit John and Joyce and stayed at the ranch for a week or so,
all of them verify what John and his wife Joyce have been saying for over two decades.


In the many hours I spent with John recording conversations and putting together this story,
I tried numerous times to get John to talk about the abductions,
but it's a topic that he finds too personal to include in the book.
Most people who have been abducted have a sense of privacy about the event that is akin to a rape survivor.
There's something deeply personal about the abduction phenomenon.


The world of exopolitics has gone over this material in great detail.
One of the most outspoken voices about the abduction phenomenon was Dr. Karla Turner.
She had a PhD in English literature.
She was one of the most articulate voices in the exopolitics community until her untimely death by cancer in 1995.
She was only forty-eight.
She captured the abduction phenomenon perfectly in a 1992 book published by Berkeley Press titled *Into The Fringe*.
Dr. Turner lived with her husband in rural Arkansas,
deep in the woods by a river in the mountains.


She also authored the book *Taken*,
which inspired a television miniseries produced by Steven Spielberg,
whether he accredits her or not.
Spielberg's miniseries brings in the multi-generational aspect of abductions,
which is undeniably the cornerstone of Turner's work. 
Dr. Turner states in her many lectures available on YouTube that she was not able to fully understand the abduction phenomenon until she engaged other abductees and interviewed them.
She makes it very clear that trying to understand the abduction phenomenon from your own experiences alone will produce an incorrect picture of the phenomenon.
John and Joyce Edmonds have never gone out into the world as abductees and discussed the abduction phenomenon that they have been through,
nor,
in my many conversations with John,
did I get the sense that he had done an extraordinary amount of research into the abduction phenomenon.



When Dr. Turner did her work in the early nineties,
the UFO community had not fully blossomed to the degree that it has now in the early twenty-first century.
The History Channel was not doing a series called *Ancient Aliens*.
People were not talking about the connection between native mythologies,
Biblical references,
and references in other scriptures,
as extraterrestrial contact.
Now they are.


One of the refreshing aspects of Dr. Turner's circumspection of the abduction phenomenon is that she didn't rest on any patented answers.
She even refused to designate them as alien abductions,
and stated as a matter of fact that nobody can say for certain whether these entities are extraterrestrial,
interdimensional,
originating on the earth,
or a combination of the three or more.
The injection of extraterrestrial into the narrative is an entirely human conjecture,
or at least it was at the time that Dr. Turner was doing her work thirty years ago.


The human record shows interaction with nonhuman intelligent and individuated life forms in all civilizations.
The Celtic people had their fairies and gnomes.
The Chinese had their Dragons as did the English.
European peoples had their angels and demons.
Dr. Turner states the design of the abduction experience is done deliberately to leave no tangible evidence for a community response.
In fact,
the abduction phenomenon has all the hallmarks of a spiritual experience.
It is no more possible for a third party to experience what an abductee experiences than it is for that same third-party to understand what Francis of Assisi was trying to describe as the result of his alleged mystical experiences.





I don't seek to define these things at an experiential level.
I just don't know whether they are alien abductions or not.
I do validate these experiences as part of the fourth wall that our reality has been constructed with.
In the fourth wall of our reality we are the actors unaware we are on a cosmic stage and the break occurs when the producers and directors speak to us.
The fourth wall in the human experience is our inner life.
Until a human being has an awakening experience,
the assumption is that the inner life is the product of the mind,
the imagination,
and all of the parts of us that constitute consciousness,
and all of it is private and the sole experience of the individual.
These fourth wall experiences all have characteristics in common.
The people who experience them,
always alone,
whether they be Moses talking to a burning bush,
or Christ talking to Satan in the desert,
or an abductee claiming that aliens were inside their head,
all experience this breach of the human fourth wall,
the subjective world is defined as having objective qualities.
Normally this is defined as insanity.
But what do you do when large groups of people from all over the world with nothing in common start to report a common breach of the fourth wall in their own minds in the form of alien abductions?
How do you explain the commonality?
To stay with the insanity definition is to entertain the notion that mental illness,
including common and similar hallucinations
&mdash;
gray aliens,
examination tables,
disks,
blue-white lights
&mdash;
are viral,
meaning they are contagious and pass from one person to the other.
It's ludicrous,
hence my *fourth wall* allegory. 
I need something to circumscribe the phenomenon,
something that bridges the rational and the irrational,
the subjective and the objective.



When you start to see it this way,
that the inner and outer life are connected,
that human consciousness directly interacts with reality in ways other than directing the arm to pick up a cup of coffee,
then everything we know about reality gets turned upside down.
This basic message of a human connection with everything around us has been given to us numerous times in so many different ways, shapes and forms they are too numerous to count.
In our desire to stay within the womb of our imagination,
the *private* world of our inner life,
we individually and collectively rationalize that these things are various forms of fiction,
mythology,
fairy tales,
religious scripture,
or mystical experiences.
The only form of human narrative to escape this death by rationalization is religious scripture,
but that war rages on in the form of radical atheists like Richard Dawkins openly suggesting that religious belief is a form of mental illness.




The only place we find experiences even remotely similar to the ET world occur in the occult and spiritual domains.
Vedic practitioners describe multiple planes of reality surrounding our physical reality,
or interacting with our physical reality but outside of the fundamental frequency by which we apprehend physicality.
It's already been described in this book that human hearing and human sight is a small bandwidth of all of the sound and light that is available to be perceived by finer instruments.
Jesus Christ stated that the kingdom of heaven is within us.
There are numerous references to a non-physical world in the Gospels
&mdash;
In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.[^6]

[^6]: John 14:2

The Quran tells us about another sentient species created by the same creator that made us that lives alongside us and can see us but we can't see them,
the Jin.
The Quran goes on to tell us that man was made from clay and the Jin were made from fire.
All around us there are examples of human consciousness interacting with worlds that don't fit into the five sense and mind reality we all share entombed within our fearful rationality.



##Naysayers Versus Pioneers


The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have seen a vigorous attempt the close the fourth wall in human experience. 
*Abducted: How People Come to Believe They Were Kidnapped By Aliens*, 
by Susan Clancy  is an attempt to deny this fourth wall in human experience. 
Clancy is a cognitive psychologist who studied at Harvard, 
where she remains a Post-Doctoral Fellow. 
Harvard became a staging ground for whether the theater of life would allow the fourth wall in human consciousness.  
Another professor, 
John Mack,
the Head of Psychiatry  at the Harvard Medical School until his strange and untimely death by a drunk driver in 2004,
was her antecedent and antipode. 


Harvard became the litmus test for whether the formal scientific and academic world would accept alien abduction and take these people seriously or shut it all down as repressed memory resurfacing in adulthood.
Mack published a book called,
*Abduction:
Human Encounters with Aliens*,
in 1994.
It is an odd twist of fate that one year after his accidental death a young,
up and coming colleague at Harvard would publish a work which completely refutes his conclusions on alien abduction,
making him look foolish and discrediting him as scientist in the field of psychiatry.


Again and again we see this battle for legitimacy,
this struggle in academic and scientific circles for authenticity among experiencers,
and again and again we see them reduced to casualties of mental illnesses or false memories.
It's really quite a feat by officialdom to keep the fourth wall in human experience closed,
and so long as officialdom does not recognize it,
the experiencers are left to fend for themselves,
struggling for dignity and credibility in a world that has labeled them insane at worst and marginalized at best.
John Mack endorsing,
or at least not dismissing,
the phenomenon of human abduction,
is perhaps the biggest nod ever from officialdom that the phenomenon is real,
that it's happening to people,
and we really don't understand what it is.
He sums up his position perfectly in a BBC interview.


>I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry. [^7]

[^7]: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4071124.stm


Curiously,
Mack never literally declared that aliens were real.
He equated the abduction phenomenon with visionary experiences throughout the human history which he noted seemed to have fallen away at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution,
so Mack gives us a kind of *fourth wall* explanation,
splitting the difference between the experiencers and scientific empiricism. 
Although all credit should be given to Mack for even taking on the subject of alien abductions at Harvard,
in the end he sort of watered it down to a kind of Joseph Campbell hero quest that was part of the spiritual traditions of the West,
nonetheless,
the abduction and exopolitics world has embraced him as validation.



The rest of the academic community,
and especially the hallowed halls of Harvard,
were not nearly as thrilled as the exopolitics community that a tenured professor
&mdash;
the head of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School
&mdash;
was writing on the nonsensical topic of alien abduction.
In May of 1994 the Dean of the Medical School,
Daniel Tosteson,
set up a committee of colleagues to go over Mack's clinical work and investigation.
Never before in the history of Harvard had a tenured professor been subject to this kind of investigation.
The committee was headed by a medical doctor named Arnold Reiman.
He was some kind of heavyweight,
a professor of medicine and of social medicine at Harvard Medical School,
and he edited the prestigious *New England Journal of Medicine*.
The committee's draft report stated:




>To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a â€˜close encounterâ€™ with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real ... is professionally irresponsible.


If that wasn't enough,
one year after his death by a drunk driver while giving a lecture in London, England,
Mack's work is completely contradicted by his antithesis personality at the Harvard School of Medicine,
Susan Clancy,
who publishes her work on the topic.


Clancy completely dismisses and even ridicules the abduction theory as a literal phenomenon.
According to her work,
the abduction scenarios are the product of sleep paralysis and the use of hypnosis in the recovery of forgotten memories.
She notes that all of the subjects reporting abduction phenomena had a previous interest in the paranormal and were invested emotionally in creating abduction memories.


It was a devastating blow for people who claimed abduction experiences.
Clancy was quoted as saying the following as it regards the response of abductees to her work.



>I can tell you most of them that have read the book are upset. I have to be honest with that. And I understand why, because what's happening in the book is I am presenting my own opinion, but I'm challenging their deeply held beliefs, beliefs that are very important to them. So they're angry, and I feel terribly about it.


She also, 
in agreement with her predecessor at Harvard, 
John Mack, 
gives a nod to religious belief and abduction experiences when she says the following:

>All I would like to say is that in the same way that people find meaning in their religious beliefs and experiences, these people find meaning in their alien abduction beliefs and their alien abduction experiences.

And just like that,
the promise of support for abductees from high up in the medical community was taken away.
It was again relegated to the superstitious and nonsensical contortions of immature minds that didn't understand themselves and bizarre belief systems percolating in the unconscious.
Curiously,
Clancy's follow-up work was on childhood sexual abuse.
The book was titled *The Trauma Myth: The Truth About Sexual Abuse Of Children And It's Aftermath*.
It was published in 2010.
She states that the genesis of the book was research she was doing in the nineties which had her commence the interviewing of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse.
And by the timing of her books on the abduction phenomenon and childhood sexual abuse,
we can assume a cognitive overlap in abduction and childhood sex abuse research.
What Clancy overlooks,
rather suspiciously,
is the highly sexual nature of abductions.
Abductees report semen extraction,
anal penetration,
and feelings similar to those of a rape survivor,
with violation being the principal trauma inducing emotion.
In fact,
it may easily be adduced that Clancy is postulating childhood sexual abuse as one of the main traumatic memories in the unconscious which fabricate abduction scenarios in adults.
The parallels are present.
Childhood sexual abuse happens in childhood.
The abduction phenomenon usually begins with repressed memories resurfacing through some form of hypnotherapy and the hypnotized person going back to their *childhood* and identifying that as the time that the abductions began.
What Clancy does not explain in her work,
aside from an allusion to abduction seduction
&mdash;
many abductees fantasized about meeting aliens
&mdash;
is the commonality of the experience,
the blue-white light beam,
the operating table,
and,
in many instances,
the presence of human beings in military uniforms.
Perhaps Clancy sees the uniforms as some kind of sadomasochistic sexual fantasy.
In any event,
her work and her opinions do not explain the phenomenon of abduction.
They dismiss it,
which might have been Harvard's goal all along,
the esteemed Ivy League institution wanting desperately to wash off the *stench* Mack put on them when he loaned credibility to the abduction phenomenon.
Finally,
to be thorough in the vetting of this topic,
many in the rather conspiracy-minded UFO world believe Mack was murdered.
The circumstance of his death is quite odd.
He was not crossing the street in London when struck.
The car jumped the sidewalk and struck him.
The driver was arrested,
and he plead guilty to careless driving under the influence.
Mack's family sent a letter to the court to be read during sentencing that asked for leniency,
and expressing their conviction there was no malice on the part of the driver,
certainly an act of heroic compassion and forgiveness on the part of the Mack family.
Most people in a similar circumstance would seek the maximum penalty,
if not for their own pain,
then for the safety of the public,
as alcoholic drivers don't often reform even after inflicting massive loss on others.



There's one final thing to address in looking at Harvard's foray and then rapid departure from abductions
&mdash;
sex.
If we are going to talk about abductions then we have to talk about human reproduction. 
Many abductees report sexual interaction.
Women report being impregnated.
Men report having their seed extracted.
At the center of this conjecture is the theory of an alien-human hybrid program. 
The women report having their fetuses taken before full term.
There is no evidence they were ever even pregnant. 
However,
they stand by their claims.


As you move deeper into the more paranoid world of conspiracy theories that conflate alien abduction with human agendas,
we have a theory of genetic lines on the planet that host non-human beings.
One example of this is the work of the British researcher, David Icke.
He claims many of the powerful family bloodlines on the planet are reptilian-human hybrids.
Fantastically,
he,
and others,
claim these beings are capable of shape shifting between human and reptilian form,
and,
most curiously,
they require or crave sex with children,
especially prepubescent boys.
There is no really clear explanation for this,
however,
some researchers,
like the American YouTuber and lecturer,
Kerry Cassidy of *Project Camelot*,
postulate that what they want is an energy human beings have at the base of the spine,
a psycho-spiritual energy called *kundalini* in Vedic texts,
or what some refer to as *chi*, 
or *prana*,
a life giving energy that yogis and Taoists,
among others,
attest heals,
allows for supernatural acts and perception,
and is particularly present in prepubescent boys.
Some western researchers
&mdash;
certainly not in the halls of the Ivy League like Harvard
&mdash;
claim the human race is farmed by transdimensional entities for this energy.
This was the conclusion of Robert Monroe discussed in a previous chapter.
This is where he claims he heard the word *lush*,
which is what the beings in Monroe's out of body experiences called the human energy being taken.


This aspect of the story might not be worth addressing if not for the high profile dismantling of child sex trafficking networks. 
Jeff Epstein procured child sex partners for the rich and famous.
Photographs and air transit logs connect him to American presidents and British royals,
thus bolstering Icke and Cassidy's conjecture that elites are mired in pedophilia.
Now,
as for an alien connection,
the curious point of intersection is the work of Harvard fellow,
Susan Casey,
who tackled two main topics in her Harvard research
&mdash;
abductions and childhood sexual abuse.
Her work on abductions is utterly dismissive and an insult to experiencers.
Her follow-up work is a refutation of the idea that sex with children damages them,
that,
in fact,
it is the realization in adulthood that society views them as having been violated and abused that causes the trauma,
in essence,
tying together alien abductions and pedophilia,
a coincidence which cannot be overlooked.
