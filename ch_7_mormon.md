The Mormon Tax Man and Desert Shoes
========================================


The direct encounter with the grays at night time was more than a little bit disturbing.
Put yourself in my shoes.
Human beings are built for experiences far outside what any reasonable person might call normal.
You would be amazed at what a human being can assimilate.
Normal is a place people gather to pretend we live in a world we understand.
Normal is a bus stop on planet earth in the middle of a nearly infinite multiverse,
full of dimensions separated by frequency.
Human ears can only hear sounds within a certain sound range.
That total sound range represents maybe less than one percent of all of the vibrations that would constitute a sound.
And yet within that one percent we have an entire reality to live within.
The same goes for our sight.
Our eyes are created to see things within a certain light spectrum,
which represents about one percent of the total light spectrum,
yet we have an entire reality built around what we can see and hear on planet earth.

My normal had been blown wide open,
leaving me naked and vulnerable in a new reality I had no experience with.
I had heard of the gray aliens before.
It was hard not to,
especially with the *X-Files* on TV.
They were the race of aliens that everybody associated with the abductions.
They were said to be extremely unpleasant and frightening.
I can't say the nighttime encounter was pleasant,
but,
at the same time,
I wasn't chilled to my bone the way most people might be.
I have a different sort of constitution.
It takes a lot to cause me distress.
Miraculously,
Joyce didn't wake up.
People who snore heavy sleep heavy.
Nonetheless,
I told her the next morning.
It was something of a relief for her.
Just as it was something of a relief for me.
I think all people want mystery to end.
And for us,
the mystery of what was in the house had ended.
It was not the sum total of what was in our house,
but I don't want to get ahead of my story.


The gray took a baseball bat to the head,
and the little bastard didn't go down.
I was going to have to up my game.
I think part of their modus operandi is to stay hidden.
Once they're known,
the visitations become much more frequent.
Maybe they had always been frequent and I had never woken up before.
God knows what they were doing in the bedroom.
But now that I knew about them they were far less subtle in their coming and going.
I started to see them on the ranch quite frequently.
In the daytime,
the evening,
the dawn when I was up,
and in the middle of the night when they woke me.


My encounters escalated to gunfire.
Bullets didn't kill them.
They made their hissing sound when they got shot,
like a soccer ball being stabbed,
a soft expulsion of air,
but they didn't fall to the ground like human beings.
We human beings can normalize a lot of things,
but waking up in the middle of the night for a gunfight with gray aliens is not one of the things that's on that list.
I didn't know for sure if they were coming for me or Joyce or both of us.
But we started sleeping in different bedrooms.


It didn't help.
They managed to find us no matter where we went.
It wasn't an every night occurrence.
It's hard to describe the frequency.
The time between visits was long enough you could forget the visitations were going on.
It was a little bit like having vermin in your house.
Every once in a while you'd see the mouse but not all the time.
I quickly gave up on the guns.
If they didn't stop the grays,
there was no point in using them.
They're too dangerous.
I had to think of a new way to deal with them.


As all of this was going on,
I had to deal with the more perfunctory aspects of running a ranch.
I needed somebody to do my taxes,
and so I began to look for a reputable accountant.
A gentleman in the area was recommended to me,
and I went to visit him.
He was the head of the Mormon Church.
In their church structure the head of a certain region or jurisdiction is the bishop.
He ran an office out of a strip mall in Buckeye.
I didn't make an appointment.
I just walked in one day.
He was an affable fellow as most Mormons are,
then again,
they are a conversion religion,
so they always have a sales mandate when they're meeting with you.
I know a little bit about their doctrine,
and,
oddly enough,
it's an extraterrestrial doctrine.
Mormons believe in a universe with multiple planets inhabited by human life.




I can't remember how long after the open encounters with the grays this meeting with the Mormon accountant was.
Time has sort of blurred for me now over the two decades plus that I've lived here at the ranch.
I'm doing my best to give you some kind of a chronology in this story,
but please forgive me if I can't get everything down to the day and month.
If you study your own history,
you'll notice that it's event-driven,
not date driven.
That's the way the human mind works.
Our memory centers around events that have great emotional value,
whether that value is extreme suffering or extreme joy.
Most of my experience at the ranch has been trauma,
which is a very defined event marker in human memory.



For the purposes of this story,
we will refer to the Mormon Bishop as Fred.
On my first visit to his strip mall office I was offered a water,
which I accepted.
I sat down in a chair in front of his desk.
He asked what he could do for me.
I told him I needed an accountant to manage the taxes for a new business which I had undertaken.
He asked about the business.
I explained to him it was a ranch,
and that I was going to be offering an animal shelter for abandoned dogs and horses,
and that I wanted to operate as a non-profit.
He seemed quite pleased with the idea.
He began to detail some of the problems with non-profits and some of the unique aspects of the accounting,
and then he got around to location.
When I told him where my ranch was the blood went out of his face.


That place has quite a reputation,
he said.


I assured him I knew nothing of the reputation before I bought it,
and that I felt in a lot of ways I had been taken advantage of by the Realtor.
That's why I didn't sell.
I gave him my stock answer,
the same answer I've given everybody for two and a half decades.
I'm not going to be run off my property by anything.


He asked me what was going on at the ranch.
I gave him the briefest overview without telling him about the gray aliens.
I told him about things disappearing and dropping out of the air on top of my head.
I told him about the fridge door opening and food flying out of the fridge,
and I told him about pots and pans rattling around in the kitchen.
Maybe I should have told him about the gray aliens.
I don't know.
Put yourself in my position.
How many people would you tell? 
The funny thing about public opinion about something,
and the *X-Files* had given everybody a public opinion,
is that you can't get any clean and objective interpretation of phenomenon.



I have sometimes thought over the years that the world of fiction is a precursor,
a kind of avant-garde for human consciousness and what it's going to be dealing with in reality.
The *X-Files* was a perfect example of this.
The problem is,
once the idea is out in the open through fiction,
anyone who comes across the idea in real life immediately assumes that you're imitating the drama from a television show like the *X-Files* to garner attention for yourself.
It's really quite astounding how simple and primitive the human mind is.
So I left the aliens out when I described the ranch to Fred the Mormon accountant. 


After coming up with a tax strategy and a pricing plan,
Fred got back to the ranch.
I guess he wanted to do me some kind of a solid.
Maybe it was an attempt to get me into the Mormon Church.
Who can say? 
But he straight-up asked me, Have you ever thought about an exorcism? 

I told him no,
I had never thought about getting the ranch exorcised.

It was then that I began to regret not talking about the aliens.
His mind had set on a spiritual disturbance on the ranch.
Everyone in Buckeye knew the history of my ranch.
They knew about the brothel,
and they knew about the shootout with the white supremacy group,
the Sons of Gestapo,
and they knew about the teenage boy putting the shotgun in his mouth the day of his high school graduation.
It was not hard to understand why the bishop thought the place might be haunted.
I had gotten myself into a jackpot there.
Fred wasn't going to take no for an answer.
We set a date for an exorcism about a month in the future.
He said he needed some time to prepare,
to confer with his congregation,
and to decide which of his congregants were ready and capable of assisting him in the spiritual cleansing of my ranch.




I continued some of my daytime activities when Joyce was at work.
I tinkered around the ranch
&mdash;
installed new water systems,
repaired fences,
tended to the animals,
went to the feed store,
and spent time with the dogs,
two at a time
&mdash;
I also continued to go out into the desert in the Jeep.
I began to enjoy this more and more.
There's something quite peaceful about the desert.
It's very barren,
flat,
loaded with scrub brush,
and full of different kinds of engaging colors from red and orange to a kind of coffee colored earth,
based on the iron content.
The rising rock formations,
the mountains in the distance,
and the way the sky sat on top of the whole desert calmed me somehow.



Joyce was not thrilled about the Mormons.
She felt ashamed.
I could understand where she was coming from.
A lot of times when you have really negative activity going on,
your knee-jerk reaction is to think that people are going to blame you,
somehow think that you're responsible for what's going on around you,
that you're what's attracting the evil,
and that you're going to be judged as such.
I assured her to the best of my ability that the Mormon Bishop understood the history of the ranch and made no such designation and placed no judgment upon us for the negative activity going on at the ranch.
In a moment of conversational victory over me,
she smugly asked if I told him about the gray aliens.
I said I had not.
She smiled and made eye contact with me until it was so uncomfortable I had to look away.
We both understood.
There are some things we were both embarrassed about and would not talk about in public,
reinforcing her position about the exorcism.
She was worried about Mormons coming into the house.
If they had any success in cleaning up the house,
would there be an obligation on us to join the Mormon Church,
which Joyce had no interest in doing whatsoever,
and,
truth be told,
neither did I.
Anyway,
it was decided,
the Mormon Bishop and a couple of his congregants would come over and say some prayers,
walk around the house with their holy instruments,
and make themselves feel good.
If it had any effect on what was going on at the ranch,
that would just be an ancillary benefit to Joyce and I,
but we both felt a little bit guilty about not talking about the alien presence.




The appointed day finally came for the Mormon bishop and his congregants to arrive.
I got the phone call that they were fifteen minutes out,
so I went out and opened up the front gate and then walked back to the house and waited for them.
A minivan turned into my long laneway a little while later,
and I watched it slowly amble up the laneway.
The bishop was in the front passenger seat.
The driver was unknown to me.
The side door slid open,
revealing one other person in the minivan,
for a total of three.
They wore white shirts and dark slacks with patent leather shoes,
and they were all clean cut and looked like Mormons.
I opened the front door as they walked up.
I greeted them all.
Joyce was there with me and she greeted them all as well.
They had a solemnity about them,
an aura of their mission.
They each in their own way looked a little bit disturbed and a little bit confused.
We offered refreshments like water and cake but they wanted to get right down to business.
The bishop had a small black satchel with him.
He went over to a side table,
placed it down,
and opened it up.
He handed a string of beads to each of them,
and he placed a string of beads around his own neck.
He pulled out a Bible and then closed the satchel.
They turned to face one another and leaned their heads in like a football huddle. 
I couldn't hear what was being said. 
The bishop spoke in a low voice. 
The acolytes were younger than him. 
I would place them in their late twenties or early thirties. 
I imagined they were being groomed to become Mormon exorcists themselves. 
My ranch was a testing ground for them.
When they broke their huddle,
the bishop turned and looked at Joyce and I. 
He made deliberate eye contact with each of us and held it for several seconds. 
He bowed his head and then turned to begin.


The bishop led the way,
holding the Bible in front of him,
his two acolytes walking behind him,
the three of them forming a kind of triangle,
the way geese fly south in the winter.
They were all reciting prayers,
their lips moving and soft humming Whispers coming out of them. 
They intermittently closed and opened their eyes,
as if they were trying to maintain a connection to their inner selves and the outer reality they had to negotiate.



Joyce and I stood off to the side and watched them.
It didn't take long for the house to have a reaction.
I don't know how to describe the sound we heard.
From an engineering point of view,
it was coming from the water pipes.
It sounded like something was trying to create a voice out of the pipes.
It sounded like a moan,
a grumble,
a lamentation.
There's no physical way that water pipes could have made that sound.
The bishop and his acolytes did not change their behavior one bit.
They continued to walk through the house slowly and deliberately,
reciting their prayers.
The sound grew louder.
It moved around the house.
They entered each room they passed,
standing inside the room for a brief time reciting prayers.
When they came to the master bedroom,
one of the acolytes became extremely distressed.
The bishop broke his concentration to address the young man.
Joyce and I could not hear what was said,
but presumed it was some form of confidence-boosting,
some form of feet to the fire,
strength to the task,
faith in the lord approach to the situation.
And then,
just like that,
the situation turned.
The hunter suddenly became the hunted.
The acolytes and the bishop had looks of extreme distress on their faces.
The acolyte who first showed weakness bent over and vomited.
He started to turn a kind of green.
It was like he got botulism in thirty seconds.
The bishop was consumed with tending to him and gave up the task of reciting his prayers.
There was a banging in the walls.
The whole house had a malevolent feel.
Joyce and I stood in the center of the living room sort of bemused by the whole situation.


As the Mormon exorcism team began to fall apart,
the sound grew louder and moved through the house.
The bishop gave a signal to his two acolytes for everybody to leave the house.
They made a hasty retreat out the side door.
Whatever they stirred up followed them outside and the one who got sick continued to vomit, 
then,
with a slight respite from the upheavals of his stomach,
he ran to the minivan and locked himself inside.
The bishop and his one remaining support person tried to continue on with the prayers as the sound went down the well and echoed from the bottom like a growling and snarling demonic beast.
That was about the limit of the bishop's tolerance.
He grabbed his one remaining acolyte,
hightailed it to the car,
got in,
pulled out quickly and drove away.


Joyce and I stood outside for a couple minutes,
speechless and dumbfounded.
Then I looked at her and said,
You think that was aliens? 


She turned and looked me in the eyes and just shook her head,
No.


The one thing that the Mormon visit did point out was that there was more going on at the ranch than just aliens.
It seems as though I was living in some kind of lower fourth dimension bus station,
replete with disembodied spirits,
perhaps some demonic presence,
and whatever else we had not yet encountered.
The one thing I firmly understood after the encounter with the Mormons was that the ranch was a unique place on the planet.
