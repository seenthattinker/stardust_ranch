Weird and Violent
=========================================

I can't overstate at this point the incredible sense of dread I had living at the ranch.
By around month three,
there was no denying that I was going through something heretofore unknown,
and my life had changed.
There was no more normal,
no more idyllic ranch with tranquility,
nothing more than fear and trepidation,
a reality I had never fully contemplated,
articulated in horror movies and novels,
and fringe paranormal groups.
Joyce was outside my understanding that first year.
She hadn't been initiated like I had.
She had the *force* working on her,
the foul moods,
the eruptions of anger.
I knew what she was going through.
I had been put through it first,
being the one home at the ranch,
morning to night,
Monday to Friday.

The topic of moving came up again and again.
Joyce affirmed her intuition.
She had been right.
It was time to accept our losses,
put the property up for sale,
find somebody as gullible as we were to buy it,
and get the hell out of Dodge.
I couldn't do it.
I wanted to make Joyce happy.
I did,
however,
I could not leave.
I felt like a coward.
I felt like I was being run off my home.
Some ancient territorial defense consciousness awoke inside me.
It's like a variation on the fight or flight impulse.
I was not going to take flight.
I was going to fight.


The violence did not stop with the dog.
I had horses killed.
It was always the same story.
I would wake up in the morning to find the animal.
The horses were killed in a manner equally bizarre but different than the dog.
They were eviscerated.
What was being done to the animals was beyond any comprehension.
It would be hard to believe human beings did it even if a team of surgeons showed up in the middle of the night.
The cuts and what was done to the bodies were not the product of human hands or instruments.
The mystery of silence attended every animal slaughter.
There was never any noise from any of the other animals.
It didn't happen on a weekly or even a monthly basis.
It just kept happening randomly over the years,
always when enough time had passed so we forgot all about it.


##Branded


The next thing to visit us at the ranch was the marking of our flesh,
anomalous markings on the outside of our bodies,
in some cases quite large,
imprinted almost like brands,
the way you would brand a horse or a cow.
The truly odd thing about this was Joyce seemed unaware of it,
which is very strange because most women are acutely aware of their physical appearance,
but she seemed to not even notice that her body had been deformed in certain areas while she slept.
It was a kind of disassociation,
and at times it struck me almost as a kind of induced disassociation.
To this day both of us look like we've been in horrible car crashes,
with puncture marks and long scars and other deformities all over our bodies.
All of these markings took place in our sleep.
Years later,
when we knew what we were dealing with,
they became more brazen.
One time I was sitting on the ground in front of the television in the living room,
the main room of the ranch,
and I felt an intense heat on the back of my right calf,
as though a red hot grill from a barbecue was pressed against the back of my calf.
I screamed out in pain.
I was branded.
There were burn marks on the back of my calf.
Nothing ever appeared in the room.
Smoke had come off the back of my calf and the smell of burning flesh wafted through the air.
But this was years into living at the ranch.
In the beginning the force didn't reveal itself so convincingly.
It was more subtle the first couple years,
as though fully revealing itself was its trump card,
to be played only when absolutely required.



Truth be told,
things hadn't even started yet.
As I think back on this,
now living on the ranch just shy of a quarter-century,
the only answer I can give is male pride.
I had sunk all of my life savings or nearly all of my life savings into the ranch and I just could not envision a situation where I retreated,
because I would take a huge loss selling the ranch under quick terms,
and it wasn't something I was willing to face.
I keep telling myself this.
I've always told myself this.
The truth is I don't know why I stayed.
Maybe I was addicted to how the ranch made me feel,
special,
chosen,
entitled.
Even with all the horror there was something profound about living at Stardust Ranch.
Mixed in with the bad energy,
the markings on our bodies,
the dead animals,
and the disappearing items,
there were moments equal and opposite to the negative,
a kind of pendulum swing into bliss and peace.
I know how this all must sound,
crazy,
but I have lived it and I bare witness,
as does Joyce.
In spite of all I have told you,
something made the ranch special.



I permanently changed my life and Joyce's life.
I made decisions for both of us that have affected her enormously.
We fought a lot in the first few year.
We started to get into some humdingers,
arguments and fights so fierce that if we had neighbors within a half mile we would have had the police called on us.
The only thing that saved us from a 911 call from a concerned neighbor was probably all the open space around us.
Dishes were thrown.
Expletives were commonplace at that time in our lives.
Bursts of anger and vitriol in both of us were becoming the norm.
We always made up after the fights,
but we always fought again.
At the root of it was this evil at the ranch that wanted us gone.
I couldn't tell Joyce this.
She wasn't ready to accept it in the first few years.
She wasn't at the house day and evening.
She came home late and slept.
She woke up early and left again. 
On Saturdays we did chores and were out most of the day.
Saturday evenings we usually watched a movie.
Sundays we rode horses and went on long walks with the dogs.
The weekends helped us reconnect.
It was during the week we fought.
The force at the ranch did this on purpose.
It didn't reveal itself to Joyce the way it did with me.
She was still at the first stage of the realization.
The bad moods in Joyce were the result of the unseen force.
This was stage one.
She was not having things disappear yet.
She hadn't entered phase two.
The dead dog was phase three,
but Joyce didn't accept it as such because she hadn't graduated from phase two.
The human mind fought the growing reality,
the supernatural nature of it.
This was all normal.
Joyce believed human beings killed the dog.
Without noticing the change in pressure,
the slight difference in temperature that came on quickly,
connecting the dog with the supernatural force was too far out.
She didn't have any idea *how* human beings flattened the dog and disappeared all the blood and innards'
or *how* they kept the animals quiet,
or,
most importantly,
*why* in the hell people would do that.
She couldn't see it for what it was.
Her mind was fighting her.
I couldn't really blame the ranch on our fights
that allowed Joyce to launch into her *I told you so* argument which validated her intuition not to buy the ranch.
The invisible force had painted me into a corner with my wife.




It would be easy for anyone to ask at this point why the ranch was not sold.
Money's not everything in life.
Even if I lost forty percent of my initial investment,
it still would have been enough to restore the peace in our lives and move forward.
To this day I can't offer any reasonable answer as to why I didn't do that.
It's almost as though staying there was part of the spell the place had on me.
I wasn't going to let it win. 
At a psychological level I had been locked into some kind of ankle trap,
the way old fur gatherers used to trap animals in the bush in Canada.
I could not get out of the place.
I could not live with myself.
I could not live with the idea of giving up.
The mystery of what was going on began to take root in my mind as a great mystery that I felt ordained to solve.

##A Call to Arms

I started buying more weapons.
I had never been a gun person,
but I thought that a revolver was suitable self-defense for living in such a remote area,
as I've already articulated in this story,
but now I was buying more guns.
I was buying long arms and automatic weapons like AK-47s.
I was becoming like one of those survival nuts.
I couldn't get enough weapons.
I practiced a lot.
The sound of machine gun fire echoed through Rainbow Valley.
I put targets up and practiced my pistol,
sniper rifles,
and automatic weapons. 
I was also buying large knives and laying baseball bats and other defense items throughout the house so that there was easy access to self
defense in almost any ten square feet in the house.
It sounds like some cheesy action movie from Hollywood,
but that's what I had been reduced to
&mdash;
some kind of dumb animal,
cornered and beyond non-violent resolution.

Joyce made her final appeal by asking me why I would not just sell the ranch.
I said it was because it was one of the largest things I'd ever taken on in my life,
and I wasn't going to run away from it.
That's not how I operate.
What comes at me in my life I face,
and I always win.
It may take a while,
but I always win.
We began to move away,
and I told her if she needed to leave,
end the marriage,
or whatever she needed to do,
that she needed to go do it,
because I was not leaving the ranch until I was damn good and ready,
and I would not leave until I got the upper hand.
I didn't give a rat's ass about otherworldly or supernatural adversaries.
A line had been drawn in the sand.
Anything that crossed it had to deal with me.


##Agreement to Stay

It was decided that we would stay at the ranch.
Maybe I was a little obstinate in my position,
but there is no way I was running from the ranch.
Once Joyce understood my position,
we stopped arguing about it.
In my trips out and about in the local area during the day,
when I would pack a couple of the dogs in the truck and go to town,
or go to other towns,
or my local feed store,
or wherever,
I started dropping little hints about what happened to my dog at the ranch.
I learned that animal mutilations were somewhat common where I lived.
People would give me a funny glance at first,
then they would lean in and whisper something like,
*that goes on around here*.
Nobody wanted to sit down and have a coffee and talk about it at length.
It was like a dirty little secret among all the people in the area,
and later I found out through my research it wasn't just my area of Arizona;
it was all of Arizona.


I decided to bring the local authorities into my research.
I contacted the Department of Agriculture for Arizona and spoke to them.
I was given an unofficial conversation with a person who worked inside the office.
I was told that there would be no official confirmation of the bloodless mutilations that had been happening to Arizona ranchers for an indeterminate amount of time.
The government had no official position on the phenomenon.
However,
off the record,
the civil servant was more than happy to give me thirty minutes of his time.
Yes,
it was quite common for horses,
cattle,
sheep,
and dogs to be found bloodlessly mutilated.
I was told that the prevailing thesis was that it was a non-human presence that was mutilating the animals.
It was an interesting choice of words,
non-human.
It wouldn't have been any great leap to say extraterrestrial.
In the years that I've been researching what happens to me and my wife on my ranch,
I've found a tight-lipped government at every turn.
There is something about the extraterrestrial phenomenon on this planet that the government just does not want to talk about.
It doesn't matter how overwhelming the evidence is,
how many people are having direct experiences with these bloodless mutilations and laser precise incisions into animals that surely are not the work of random poachers or vandals,
the government doesn't want to talk about it.
The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office was equally tight-lipped.
They gave me far less time than the Department of Agriculture.
I came across a documentary called *A Strange Harvest* by Linda Moulton Howe,
a reporter out of Denver Colorado who had been tracking the animal mutilation phenomenon.
It was interesting to hear her say that UFOs had a part in the mutilations.
Many of the farmers reported seeing orange lights in the sky and crafts just around the time of the mutilations.
I couldn't believe what I was reading.
It was exactly what I was experiencing at Stardust Ranch,
including the orange lights in the desert.
Linda has gone on to be an important figure in the exopolitics world,
lecturing all around the globe on many facets of the extraterrestrial presence on the planet,
but she started out as a regular television reporter drawn into the animal mutilations.


##Doppelgangers

This next part of my story I tell with some trepidation,
wondering if anyone will even believe it.
I guess the best way to tell you is to give you an example.
It started on a Friday night.
Joyce and I had decided to go out for dinner in Phoenix.
We were getting ready,
which took a lot less time for me than it did for Joyce,
and when I was dressed and ready to go,
I sat and waited for Joyce in the living room.
As many a man has experienced,
going out in public with your woman can entail some preparation for the woman.
I turned on the TV and settled in for an indeterminate period of time,
knowing as all men do that to rush the situation would not do me any good whatsoever.


I was watching the news when I heard her voice behind me say,
I'm ready.
I turned around and there she was in a beautiful red dress,
her makeup done and her lipstick on and her earrings and all of the adornments that go along with a woman presenting herself to the public alongside her man.
It was a lot for a Tex-Mex restaurant in Phoenix,
but who am I to change the way things have been done on this planet for millennia.
Joyce went out the front door and got into the Jeep.
I went out the back door and did one final reconnaissance of the animals to make sure everything was all right.
The dogs were in their crates and the horses were happily docile on their range,
and everything looked good,
so I walked around the side of the house and up to the laneway and got into the driver's seat with Joyce who was waiting for me in the passenger seat.


I turned on the car and drove out the long dirt laneway.
There was very little traffic on the highway.
It was a perfect time for driving.
Joyce was always more animated when we were outside of the house.
In this time alone outside the house,
driving with Joyce,
I always met my wife again.
I know that sounds strange,
but she disappeared inside that house.
She didn't show up too much.
We'd only been married about seven years at that point,
and already it seemed like the marriage was in trouble.
She was a good and loyal woman and had no intention of leaving me by divorce,
but being out of the house and being distant all the time was her way of surviving what was going on around us.
She understood my position that to try and sell the ranch at that point would necessitate a huge loss,
and she accepted that my position was to triumph over this situation.


I enjoyed hearing about her work at the FBI when we were alone and outside of the house.
I knew it always made her feel good and it was something that she could talk about.
I wasn't given names or actual details,
because that would be a breach of her oath of office,
but I was given highlights of what the crime situation in Arizona was like,
and especially Phoenix.
There's organized crime all over America and every state has its variation of it.
Arizona had a serious child trafficking problem and a human trafficking problem with Latin Americans that came over the border.
Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County was quite amusing and a topic that came up at the FBI quite a bit.
He was like a character out of an old John Wayne movie and the federal agents found him extremely amusing and antiquated.
Joe is well-liked at a federal level and got all around the country and a lot of people knew him.
So the feds were cautious about stepping on his toes.
Also, 
America is in some way still a feudal country and the title of sheriff is
&mdash;
within its jurisdiction
&mdash;
just about the most powerful person in law enforcement,
so the FBI didn't bother Joe in any way.


I took my turn at small talk and explained to Joyce a new water system I had been thinking about based off of a large standing tank to better water the horses.
I also explained that we needed more fencing in the back of the property,
and that I was going to go to the hardware store on Monday and get the supplies.
We talked about getting more dogs,
I wanted to get up to twenty-six or thirty,
and Joyce was fine with that.
She knew I loved animals,
and she wanted to be supportive.
Like I said,
this time alone outside the house was the only time we had an opportunity to be a married couple.
The topic of the ranch and what was happening to us with the lights in the sky,
the mutilated animals,
and everything else,
was not something we talked about in our private time outside the house.
After a casual forty-five minute drive,
we arrived at our destination, 
a Tex-Mex restaurant with a good reputation in Phoenix.
I dropped Joyce off at the front door and went to park.
By the time I got to the hostess stand Joyce was seated.
The hostess pointed out where she had sat Joyce.
I thanked her kindly and walked back to sit with my wife.



Joyce was looking at a menu.
I sat down across from her at a four-person square table and picked up my menu.
I made an appetizer suggestion and Joyce agreed.
Our server came by and I told the delightful young lady that we would like some chips and salsa and two margaritas.
She smiled in that vivacious way that servers working in a bubbly environment do and said,
I'll be right back with that for you.
She spun around and disappeared.
While I was looking at the entrees Joyce said she was going to the ladies' room.
I nodded my head without looking up and she left.
My cell phone was clipped to my belt.
It was a little uncomfortable,
pinching my skin,
so I took it off and placed it on the table in front of me.
I realized it was turned off.
It was Friday night at seven 7:45 PM.
I couldn't imagine anybody desperate to reach me,
but I turned it on nonetheless.
What's the point of having a cell phone if it's not turned on? 
It immediately started to beep.
I had messages and missed calls.
I flipped open the analog phone and saw four missed messages,
all from our home number.
I felt my heart sink.
There was nobody at home.
Was even our peace outside of the house now going to be shattered by the strange phenomenon happening at the ranch? 
I dialed into the voice messaging and waited to hear the first message.
To my shock and disbelief, 
it was Joyce.
She was furious
&mdash;
Where are you?
How could you leave the house without me?
Are you that insensitive and rude that you couldn't even wait for me?
&mdash;
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
If my wife was at home,
waiting in the house,
and I left without her,
who in the hell just went to the bathroom?


I glanced to the back of the restaurant,
the entrance hall to the washrooms.
Joyce was not returning yet.
I quickly dialed the home number.
Joyce picked up.
Where are you?
she asked.
I told her I was at the restaurant in Phoenix.
I listened to five or seven seconds of an emotional tirade from a frustrated and exasperated wife at the end of her patience.
I didn't know what to say.
I was stunned.
I told her that there were factors involved that I couldn't explain right at that moment but that she had to trust me.
I told her I'd be home in forty-five minutes.
She said okay.
I hung up the phone and nervously waited for whatever it was that would come back from the washroom.


Three minutes later.
I saw *Joyce* appear at the back of the restaurant,
near the bathrooms.
She walked back to the table and sat down.
Whatever was sitting across from me was able to intuit my mood and my thoughts perfectly.
I realized at that moment that I had never looked face to face with whatever I had brought to the restaurant in the entire drive to Phoenix.
I had been looking out the windshield,
concentrating on the road,
and what I had thought was my wife looked straight ahead as well.
Our conversation had taken place without looking at each other in the eyes.
I dropped her off at the restaurant door and parked the car.
This was the first time since I checked the animals and walked up the side of the house that I look directly into its face.
The look on my face must have told whatever that thing was that I knew it was not Joyce.
The eyes went completely black.
I don't just mean the pupil and the iris,
I mean its entire eyes turned black.
I pushed my chair back and walked out of the restaurant as quickly as I could.
I didn't even leave money on the table.
I went out to the parking lot,
got into the Jeep,
backed it up,
and sped off back home.



When I got home,
Joyce was in the living room watching television.
Her eyes and face were wet and puffy from crying.
I didn't know how to tell her this new development.
How do you tell someone what happened to me in the restaurant? 
It's beyond all reason.
I don't think I've ever read anything like it anywhere,
not even an HP Lovecraft novel.
Somehow,
the forces inside our house and around our ranch had fabricated a facsimile of my wife that was sufficient enough to fool me before I looked directly into its eyes.
I drove forty-five minutes to Phoenix with it and carried on a conversation with it as though it was my wife.
In the end I did the only thing a responsible husband could do,
I told Joyce the truth.
While I was happy to be an honest husband and tell her the truth,
I was not happy to add another layer of misery,
despair,
confusion,
and paranormal activity at the ranch.
My wife was at her breaking point already.


The doppelganger phenomenon would repeat itself several times over the years.
It was always very convincing,
and it always took a little bit of time for either myself or Joyce to figure out what we were dealing with was a doppelganger,
and yes,
it happened to Joyce as well.
A second of me was created on several occasions and fooled my wife for short periods.
Of all of the things that have happened at the ranch over the years,
the doppelganger is among the strangest.
